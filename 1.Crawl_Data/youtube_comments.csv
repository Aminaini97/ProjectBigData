Personally i think its easy. The work time should be flipped. No one really just works 8 hours, able to support entire household, and be stress free. I think we should work hard and have a high demand for 3 maybe 4 days a week. Then we are off for the other 3 or 4 days each week. 2 days off every week is just enough time to get other life stressors and task complete and no time to just decompress from responsibilities. There is no actual day of rest like the bible says. No one is wanting to do anything about it just work harder and do more....",0,2025-09-08T12:25:08Z

-I‚Äôve always worked within 15 minutes of my home. This allows me to go home on lunch every single day. I have also sacrificed money, promotions, and opportunity in order to have and maintain this luxury. 

-I do not, I repeat, I do not take my work home, and I very rarely get in early or leave late. It‚Äôs about setting boundaries. If I can‚Äôt get my work done in a solid 8 hours or 80 hours or whatever, the company is understaffed and that isn‚Äôt my problem. Period. Now there are certain times that I need to work extra, but that is up to me to manage and not the company to decide.  

-I try to SAVE and invest as much money as I can afford to and live as debt free as possible. This is, in my opinion, the biggest reason people get trapped - lifestyle inflation. It only costs ~$35k-$40k per year to live in the majority of America. Anything above that is not a necessity. I live like I make poverty wages so that the company will never own me. Create a budget, then stick to it.  

-Always have something to look forward to outside of work. It might only be one night that week but that excitement build up keeps me in the game. It‚Äôs like a reward. I worked hard all week so now I get to go out and hang with friends, or play golf, or whatever. Never let your job become your identity. 

Hope that helps some folks on their journey to finding peace in this crazy world. Get in, take what‚Äôs yours, and move along. If you don‚Äôt, someone else will. It‚Äôs a harsh reality out there but it‚Äôs possible to survive in it.",2,2025-02-13T23:40:06Z

G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"Choosing offices for certain staff while downgrading others to spaces next to dustbins and toilets, or providing them with outdated office tools, is a form of workplace discrimination and favoritism. This practice undermines equality, creates a toxic work culture, and can severely affect employee morale, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. Here's a breakdown of the key issues and their impact:

1. Unfair Allocation of Office Space: Assigning prime office spaces to favored employees while placing others in less desirable locations, such as next to dustbins or toilets, creates a clear division between staff members. This practice sends a message that certain employees are valued more than others, which can lead to feelings of resentment and inequality. The environment in which an employee works is essential to their comfort and well-being, and being placed in a subpar location can make employees feel devalued.

2. Impact on Professionalism and Productivity: Office spaces play a significant role in how employees perceive their status within an organization. Working in a clean, quiet, and well-equipped office enhances focus, collaboration, and efficiency, whereas being placed in a less desirable location can lead to distractions and a lack of motivation. Proximity to noisy areas, unpleasant smells, or high-traffic zones, such as toilets, can make it difficult to concentrate and perform at a high level. This can lead to decreased productivity, poor performance, and lower job satisfaction.

3. Inequitable Access to Resources and Technology: Providing employees with outdated office tools and technology while offering others the latest equipment creates an imbalance in the workplace. Advanced technology can enhance job performance, streamline processes, and improve outcomes. By denying certain employees access to these tools, employers are hindering their ability to succeed. This disparity in access to resources is a clear example of favoritism and can create a sense of exclusion among staff.

4. Psychological Impact: Office placement and access to technology are not just logistical issues; they can have a significant psychological impact. Being placed in an undesirable office or denied access to modern tools can make employees feel unimportant or undervalued. It can lead to feelings of alienation, frustration, and disengagement. Over time, these negative emotions can contribute to lower morale and a lack of motivation to perform well.

5. Damage to Company Culture: Favoritism in office placement and resource allocation contributes to a toxic work culture where employees feel that success and recognition are based on favoritism, rather than merit and contribution. This can foster resentment among staff and damage the trust and collaboration that are essential to a productive and cohesive team. Employees who feel excluded or marginalized may become less engaged, leading to a decrease in overall team performance.

6. Long-Term Consequences: Over time, these practices can have serious long-term effects on employee retention and the organization's reputation. Talented employees who feel consistently overlooked or mistreated may choose to leave the company for a more inclusive and fair work environment. Moreover, if these practices become widely known, they can damage the organization's reputation and make it difficult to attract top talent in the future.

How to Address the Issue:

1. Fair Allocation of Resources: Office space and technology should be allocated based on need, role requirements, and fairness, rather than favoritism. All employees should have access to the necessary tools and a comfortable work environment that supports their productivity and well-being.

2. Transparency in Decision-Making: Employers should establish clear criteria for assigning office space and resources, and communicate these criteria to staff. Transparency helps to ensure that employees feel the process is fair and based on objective factors, rather than favoritism or personal bias.

3. Promote Equality and Inclusivity: Creating a culture where all employees are treated equally and fairly is crucial for fostering a positive work environment. Employers should strive to treat all employees with respect, regardless of their position, tenure, or relationship with leadership.

4. Invest in Employee Well-Being: All employees should have access to a workspace that promotes their productivity and well-being. This includes ensuring that offices are clean, quiet, and free from distractions. Employers should also provide employees with the tools and technology they need to succeed in their roles.

5. Monitor and Address Favoritism: Leadership should be vigilant about the impact of favoritism and work to correct any imbalances in the workplace. This includes addressing any disparities in office placement, technology access, or other resources that might create division among employees.

In conclusion, choosing offices for certain staff while downgrading others and providing unequal access to office tools is a form of workplace inequality that can negatively impact employee morale, productivity, and the overall work environment. Employers must ensure that all staff are treated fairly and have equal access to resources to foster a positive, inclusive, and productive workplace.",1,2024-12-28T04:26:15Z
G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"Cherry-picking staff for projects with better prospects while positioning others with less opportunity, especially when the latter are more deserving, is a harmful and unethical practice that undermines fairness in the workplace. It creates a division among employees and can lead to frustration, resentment, and disengagement. This practice is particularly detrimental when hard-working employees are used to complete the work of favored individuals while being denied the tools and resources they need to succeed. Here's a breakdown of the key issues and their impact:

1. Unfair Distribution of Opportunities: When managers or leaders favor certain staff members by assigning them high-profile projects or positions with better career prospects, it creates an imbalance in opportunities. Employees who are more deserving, often those who are hardworking and committed, may be overlooked despite their contributions. This undermines the merit-based system and leads to a sense of unfairness in the workplace, which can negatively affect morale and motivation.

2. Exploiting Hard-Working Employees: In situations where hardworking staff are made to complete the tasks of favored employees, they are essentially being exploited. These employees may be forced to take on additional work, often without proper recognition or compensation, leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. This practice also breeds resentment, as the effort and contributions of these employees are not acknowledged in a fair and meaningful way.

3. Denial of Resources and Support: Denying employees access to the necessary tools, such as printers, uninterrupted internet access, or other resources that would allow them to perform their job effectively, is a clear tactic of sabotage. When employees are not given the resources they need, it prevents them from doing their work efficiently and can lead to delays, poor outcomes, and unnecessary stress. This further compounds the sense of inequality and mistreatment.

4. Exclusion from Key Support Staff: By asking support staff such as HR, finance, data managers, and technicians not to work with certain individuals, employers are essentially isolating those employees from the support they need to succeed. This exclusionary practice can hinder their ability to complete projects, solve problems, or get the help they need to move forward in their roles. It reinforces the power imbalance between favored employees and others, and may create a toxic work culture.

5. Impact on Employee Engagement: Employees who are constantly sidelined, excluded from important tasks, and denied access to essential resources may feel disengaged and demotivated. They may begin to question their value within the organization and lose interest in their work. This disengagement can lead to lower productivity, poor job performance, and, ultimately, higher turnover rates.

6. Toxic Work Culture: These practices contribute to a toxic work environment, where favoritism and exclusion are normalized. When employees witness unfair treatment and the manipulation of resources for certain individuals, it can erode trust in leadership and reduce collaboration across teams. This toxic culture can become ingrained, making it difficult for the organization to retain talent or foster a positive working atmosphere.

7. Long-Term Consequences: The long-term effects of such practices include a decline in employee retention, as talented and hard-working staff may leave the organization for better opportunities. The company risks losing skilled workers who contribute significantly to its success, which can ultimately impact its growth, innovation, and reputation in the market. It can also damage the employer's brand, making it harder to attract new talent in the future.

How to Address the Issue:

1. Promote Fairness and Meritocracy: Organizations must ensure that opportunities are given based on merit, skill, and contribution, not favoritism or arbitrary decisions. Implementing a transparent system for assigning projects and recognizing achievements can help employees feel that their efforts are valued and rewarded appropriately.

2. Provide Equal Access to Resources: Ensuring that all employees have access to the necessary tools and support they need to perform their job effectively is crucial. This includes providing adequate resources like technology, training, and support staff to all employees, regardless of their position or the perceived favorability of their role.

3. Encourage Collaboration Across Teams: Employers should foster a culture of collaboration, where employees work together to achieve common goals. Encouraging support staff, such as HR, finance, and technicians, to assist all employees equally ensures that everyone has access to the help they need, promoting a more inclusive and supportive work environment.

4. Transparency in Decision-Making: Clear communication about how decisions are made, particularly regarding who is chosen for important projects or leadership roles, can reduce feelings of resentment or favoritism. When employees understand the rationale behind decisions, they are more likely to feel valued and motivated.

5. Invest in Employee Development: Providing equal opportunities for professional development, training, and growth ensures that all employees have the chance to progress in their careers. This can help eliminate feelings of alienation or exclusion and give everyone a fair chance to succeed.

6. Leadership Accountability: Leaders must be held accountable for their actions and the work environment they create. Favoritism, exclusion, and denial of resources must be addressed through clear policies and procedures. Leaders should model fairness and inclusivity and encourage others to do the same.

In conclusion, cherry-picking staff for projects with prospects, while sidelining deserving employees and denying them necessary resources, is an unethical and harmful practice that can damage both individual employees and the organization as a whole. It fosters a toxic work culture, reduces productivity, and ultimately harms employee morale and retention. Addressing these issues requires a commitment to fairness, equal opportunity, and clear leadership that promotes a positive and inclusive work environment for all staff.",1,2024-12-28T04:24:27Z
G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"Alienating staff through tactics such as ignoring their greetings or threatening them with job insecurity creates a toxic work environment and can have significant negative impacts on both the individual and the organization. These behaviors are forms of emotional manipulation and bullying that can affect an employee's mental health, job satisfaction, and overall performance. Here's a breakdown of how these practices work and their harmful effects:

1. Emotional Manipulation: When staff members are deliberately ignored or excluded, it manipulates their emotions and self-worth. This tactic is used to make employees feel insignificant or unimportant, undermining their confidence and sense of belonging in the workplace. When this is combined with threats of job insecurity or shorter contracts, it creates an environment where employees feel powerless and anxious about their positions.

2. Impact on Mental Health: Prolonged exposure to exclusionary practices can lead to serious mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Employees who are alienated may start to feel isolated and undervalued, which can affect their overall well-being and hinder their performance at work. The toll on mental health can extend beyond the workplace, impacting personal life and relationships as well.

3. Undermining Job Security: Threatening staff with shorter contracts or job loss for engaging in basic social interactions, such as greeting colleagues, creates fear and insecurity. This undermines employees' sense of job security and stability. The constant threat of losing their job for trivial reasons can lead to disengagement, demotivation, and a diminished sense of loyalty to the organization.

4. Toxic Work Culture: When leadership or colleagues engage in exclusionary behaviors, it cultivates a toxic work culture. Employees may begin to avoid communicating with one another or participating in team activities for fear of being ostracized. This lack of open communication erodes collaboration, trust, and respect, which are essential for achieving shared goals and maintaining a healthy work environment.

5. Power Dynamics and Control: Alienation tactics often stem from a desire to control or manipulate employees. Leaders or individuals in positions of power may engage in these behaviors to reinforce their dominance and keep others in a subjugated position. This creates an unhealthy power imbalance, where employees are more concerned with avoiding punishment than performing their jobs effectively.

6. Employee Retention Issues: Employees who feel alienated are more likely to leave the organization, resulting in higher turnover. Exclusionary tactics and threats of job insecurity can lead to dissatisfaction, lower morale, and a lack of motivation. This ultimately harms the organization, as the loss of employees creates recruitment and training costs, and the work environment becomes less appealing to new talent.

7. Legal and Ethical Concerns: The practices of alienating employees and threatening their job security for social interactions or greetings may violate labor laws and ethical guidelines. Employees subjected to such behaviors may have legal avenues to challenge these practices, either through labor unions, employee rights organizations, or legal claims for workplace bullying and discrimination.

How to Address the Issue:

1. Promote Open Communication: Organizations should encourage open communication channels where employees can express concerns without fear of retaliation. It is essential for leadership to create a culture where all employees feel heard and respected.

2. Foster Inclusivity and Respect: A culture based on inclusivity and mutual respect can reduce the occurrence of exclusionary behaviors. Training in diversity, inclusion, and team-building activities can help employees learn how to engage with one another positively and respectfully.

3. Establish Clear Anti-Bullying Policies: Workplaces should implement clear and comprehensive anti-bullying policies that define acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Employees should be aware of how to report bullying, and management should have clear procedures for addressing complaints. Ensuring that these policies are enforced consistently helps create a fair and supportive environment.

4. Provide Support for Affected Employees: Organizations should provide support for employees who feel alienated, whether it's through HR resources, employee assistance programs, or access to counseling services. Supporting employees who are being targeted by exclusionary practices helps them cope with the emotional and mental toll and empowers them to take action.

5. Ensure Accountability: Leaders must be held accountable for creating and maintaining a positive work environment. If exclusionary behaviors are allowed to persist or are overlooked, it sends the message that such practices are acceptable. Strong leadership and accountability are crucial for addressing these issues and ensuring that all employees are treated with dignity and fairness.

In conclusion, alienating staff through exclusionary behaviors and threats of job insecurity undermines employee well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational productivity. These tactics foster a toxic work environment where trust and collaboration break down, and employees feel marginalized and demotivated. Addressing these issues requires leadership commitment to fairness, transparency, and inclusivity, as well as clear policies that prevent bullying and protect employees from emotional manipulation.",1,2024-12-28T04:21:42Z
G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"When office bullies and leadership corrupt the process of allocating benefits, such as car loans, parking spaces, and access to office amenities, it creates a highly toxic work environment. Exclusionary tactics and corrupt practices that undermine fairness and equity not only harm the individuals directly affected but can also negatively impact the entire workplace. Here's a closer look at how these issues play out and their detrimental effects:

1. Exclusionary Tactics by Office Bullies: Bullies in the workplace often use subtle or overt exclusionary tactics to target certain individuals. In the context of access to office benefits like car loans or parking spaces, these tactics may include selectively offering perks to only certain individuals, while systematically denying others access. This could be based on personal preferences, biases, or even a desire to maintain control over others. Employees who are excluded may feel demotivated, isolated, and less valued, leading to decreased job satisfaction and performance.

2. Corrupting the Process for Personal Gain: When leadership is involved in these exclusionary practices, it signals a deeper issue of corruption. Leaders who engage in corrupt behavior, such as steering resources or benefits to their favored employees, may be doing so to maintain power or control. For example, they may allocate car loans or parking spaces to employees they prefer or who are aligned with their personal interests, while denying these opportunities to others. This corrupt behavior undermines the integrity of the organization and breeds a sense of unfairness among the staff.

3. Favoritism and Unequal Treatment: When certain employees are given preferential treatment‚Äîsuch as access to loans, parking, or even the office canteen‚Äîwhile others are excluded, it creates an atmosphere of inequality. Staff members who are denied these benefits may feel that their contributions are not being recognized or valued. This can lead to resentment and division within teams, eroding trust in leadership and damaging overall morale. The perception that benefits are not allocated based on merit or need, but rather on personal relationships or favoritism, can foster a toxic culture.

4. Impact on Employee Well-being: Exclusion from perks like car loans or parking spaces can directly affect employees' daily lives. Employees who are forced to rely on public transportation, for example, may experience longer commutes, higher costs, and more stress, all of which can negatively affect their work-life balance and mental well-being. Furthermore, mocking employees for their reliance on public transport adds insult to injury, making them feel belittled and unsupported by their workplace.

5. Undermining Productivity and Performance: When leadership or office bullies corrupt processes, it distracts employees from focusing on their core tasks. The frustration and disengagement that result from being excluded or treated unfairly can lead to lower productivity and a decline in performance. Instead of being motivated by fair opportunities, employees may feel disheartened or disconnected from the organization's goals, which ultimately hurts the company's overall success.

6. Creating a Divisive Work Environment: Favoritism and exclusion create divisions within teams. Employees who receive preferential treatment may form alliances with leadership or other favored individuals, further alienating those who are excluded. This division can affect teamwork and collaboration, as employees may be less willing to share ideas, help one another, or work together effectively. The resulting toxic work environment undermines team cohesion and cooperation, which is essential for achieving organizational goals.

7. Disrupting Merit-Based Opportunities: When perks such as car loans or parking spaces are granted based on favoritism rather than merit, it disrupts the merit-based system that organizations should strive for. Employees who are excluded from these benefits may feel that their hard work and contributions are undervalued, while those who are favored may receive unearned advantages. This can demotivate employees and lead to a lack of trust in the organization's leadership and decision-making processes.

8. Increased Employee Turnover: Employees who feel consistently excluded or unfairly treated are more likely to leave the organization. High turnover can result in significant costs for the company, as recruiting and training new staff can be time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, when employees leave due to unfair practices, it damages the organization's reputation, making it more difficult to attract top talent in the future.

Addressing the Issue

1. Establish Clear and Transparent Policies: Employers should implement clear, transparent policies for allocating benefits like car loans, parking, and other perks. These policies should be based on objective criteria, such as need, merit, and job requirements, and should be communicated to all staff to ensure everyone has equal access to these opportunities.

2. Encourage Fair and Equal Treatment: Leaders should model behavior that encourages equal treatment of all employees. Favoritism should be actively discouraged, and leaders should strive to treat all staff members fairly and consistently. Ensuring equal access to resources and opportunities helps build trust and respect within the organization.

3. Create Mechanisms for Reporting Unfair Practices: Employees should have access to confidential mechanisms for reporting exclusionary practices or corruption without fear of retaliation. These reports should be taken seriously and investigated promptly to ensure accountability. Leadership must demonstrate a commitment to addressing unfair treatment and ensuring that all employees are treated with dignity and respect.

4. Promote a Culture of Inclusion: Creating a culture of inclusion, where all employees are valued and supported, helps to eliminate the harmful effects of favoritism and exclusion. Leadership should work to ensure that all staff members feel welcome and included in the workplace, regardless of their personal background, status, or relationships with others in the organization.

5. Provide Equal Access to Opportunities: Opportunities for growth, including access to car loans, parking spaces, and other benefits, should be available to all employees based on clear criteria. Employers should ensure that all employees have an equal chance to benefit from these opportunities, regardless of personal relationships with leadership or colleagues.

6. Address Bullying and Harassment: Bullying, including the exclusionary tactics you mentioned, should be addressed promptly. Leaders should set a positive example and create a zero-tolerance policy for any form of bullying or harassment in the workplace. This includes mocking employees for their transportation choices or excluding them from benefits for personal reasons.

In conclusion, when office bullies and leadership corrupt the process of allocating benefits, such as car loans, parking spaces, and other perks, it creates a toxic environment of exclusion, favoritism, and inequality. These practices undermine employee well-being, damage morale, and ultimately harm productivity. By addressing these issues and promoting fairness, transparency, and inclusion, organizations can foster a positive and supportive workplace where all employees have an equal chance to succeed.",2,2024-12-28T04:20:12Z
G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"When employers or leaders use scholarships and job positions as tools for favoritism or personal gain, it creates a toxic and unfair work environment. The practices you mentioned, such as favoring certain individuals or their children for scholarships and job opportunities, and excluding deserving staff members, undermine the principles of equity, fairness, and meritocracy. Here‚Äôs how these issues manifest and the negative impacts they can have:

Favoring Specific Candidates: When scholarship opportunities or job positions are given to certain individuals or their children, even before the recruitment or selection process begins, it creates a system of inequality. This favoritism undermines the integrity of the recruitment or scholarship process, where decisions should be made based on merit, qualifications, and need. Employees who feel that positions or scholarships are pre-determined based on personal relationships rather than abilities or qualifications may feel discouraged and disengaged, knowing that their efforts will not be recognized or rewarded fairly.

Excluding Deserving Candidates: When deserving staff members are excluded from job or scholarship opportunities because leadership has already selected candidates based on personal relationships, it leads to frustration and a sense of injustice. The exclusionary practices can demotivate employees, as they feel that their hard work and contributions are undervalued or ignored. This can foster resentment and may cause talented staff members to leave the organization, resulting in lost potential and reduced productivity.

Nepotism and Corruption: Offering scholarships or job opportunities to the children or relatives of leadership, while denying the same opportunities to other deserving staff members, constitutes nepotism. This corrupt practice not only damages trust within the organization but also breeds a culture of favoritism, where employees are more likely to feel that their chances of success are dependent on personal connections rather than their qualifications. Nepotism can also create an environment where employees are more focused on aligning with those in power rather than working towards organizational goals, stunting creativity and innovation.

Disruption of Meritocracy: A workplace built on meritocracy ensures that individuals are rewarded and recognized for their skills, qualifications, and achievements. When job positions and scholarships are allocated based on favoritism or nepotism, it disrupts the merit-based system. This results in an unfair workplace where promotions and opportunities are no longer based on merit, but on personal relationships or connections. Employees who see this happening may feel demoralized and less motivated to perform at their best, which negatively impacts the overall productivity and success of the organization.

Creating Unhealthy Competition: When leadership prioritizes personal interests over merit, it creates a competitive environment that is not based on healthy competition. Employees may feel pressured to align themselves with leadership, rather than focusing on improving their skills or contributing to the organization. This unhealthy competition can result in favoritism, backstabbing, and toxic behavior among staff members, further eroding morale and teamwork.

Undermining Organizational Integrity: Allowing favoritism to dictate the allocation of job positions and scholarships undermines the integrity of the organization. If such practices become known, they can damage the organization‚Äôs reputation both internally and externally. Employees, prospective job candidates, and other stakeholders may lose trust in the organization‚Äôs ability to uphold fairness and integrity, making it more difficult to attract and retain talent.

Impact on Employee Motivation and Engagement: Employees who perceive that job opportunities and scholarships are granted based on favoritism are less likely to be motivated and engaged in their work. When people feel that their efforts are ignored or that they have no real chance of advancement due to personal connections, they may become disengaged. This can result in reduced performance, a lack of initiative, and ultimately, a negative impact on the organization‚Äôs overall success.

Addressing These Issues

Implement Fair and Transparent Selection Processes: Employers should establish clear, fair, and transparent policies for job recruitment and scholarship allocation. Selection criteria should be based on merit, qualifications, and performance, rather than personal relationships. These policies should be communicated to all staff, ensuring that everyone understands how decisions are made and that no individual is given preferential treatment.

Promote Equal Opportunity: All employees should be given equal opportunity to apply for job positions and scholarships, regardless of their relationship with leadership. Decisions should be made based on qualifications, performance, and need. Leadership should ensure that every employee has access to the same resources and opportunities to advance within the organization.

Ensure Accountability: Leaders and managers should be held accountable for ensuring that recruitment and scholarship processes are fair and transparent. If nepotism or favoritism is discovered, those responsible should face consequences. Holding leadership accountable for their actions helps to foster trust in the organization and reinforces the importance of fairness and integrity.

Encourage Merit-Based Recognition: Employers should encourage a merit-based culture where employees are recognized and rewarded for their skills, achievements, and contributions. This includes ensuring that promotions, job opportunities, and scholarships are given based on performance, not personal relationships. A merit-based approach helps to motivate employees to perform at their best and fosters a positive and productive work environment.

Create Clear Channels for Reporting Unfair Practices: Employees should have access to mechanisms for reporting unfair practices, such as nepotism or favoritism, without fear of retaliation. These channels should be confidential, and complaints should be thoroughly investigated. By addressing complaints in a timely and fair manner, organizations can ensure that their workplace remains equitable and just.

In conclusion, favoritism and nepotism in the allocation of job positions and scholarships are clear examples of corruption that undermine fairness and equity in the workplace. By promoting transparency, accountability, and merit-based decision-making, employers can create a work environment where all employees have an equal chance to succeed, ultimately leading to greater productivity, morale, and organizational success.",2,2024-12-28T04:13:09Z
G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"Using office canteens and office functions as a means to create favoritism or as personal spaces for certain individuals, especially in leadership positions, is a form of workplace bullying and an abuse of power. This practice undermines team morale, creates division, and fosters an environment where exclusion, corruption, and inequality thrive. Here‚Äôs how these behaviors manifest and their potential impacts:

Exclusion and Social Isolation: When certain employees, particularly those in leadership positions, use the office canteen as their personal feeding space, it leads to a clear divide between those who are included and those who are excluded. Denying access to the canteen or meals during office functions creates a sense of alienation and isolation. Employees who are excluded may feel undervalued, and this can create resentment. Such behavior diminishes the sense of belonging and inclusivity, which are vital for a healthy workplace culture.

Unfair Distribution of Resources: When office functions, including meals, are paid for by the organization but certain individuals are given preferential access, it results in an unfair distribution of resources. Employees who contribute to the organization, regardless of their rank, should have equal access to these resources. When certain individuals, particularly leaders, take advantage of their positions to access special meals or take meals home while others are denied, it undermines the organization's integrity and fosters inequality.

Corruption and Favoritism: If certain individuals are allowed to demand specific meals or treat the canteen as their personal ""pot"" to choose what they want, while others are denied the same privileges, it shows clear signs of corruption. This manipulation of office resources for personal benefit creates a system where favoritism thrives. Leadership or influential staff members may use the office canteen to reward themselves while ignoring the needs and rights of other employees. This practice can foster a sense of injustice and resentment, damaging the workplace culture.

Manipulation of Office Functions: Office functions and meals are meant to bring employees together, celebrate achievements, and promote teamwork. When certain staff members, especially leadership, manipulate these events to their advantage‚Äîwhether by taking food home or limiting access to certain groups‚Äîit undermines the purpose of these functions. Rather than fostering inclusivity and community, such practices encourage division and favoritism.

Erosion of Workplace Culture: The practice of using office canteens to create exclusionary practices, whether through limiting access or demanding special meals, erodes the overall workplace culture. Employees who feel excluded from these activities or who see that their colleagues are treated unfairly may lose trust in the organization. This can lead to disengagement, decreased morale, and higher turnover rates, ultimately harming the organization's long-term success.

Long-Term Organizational Damage: If these exclusionary and corrupt practices continue, they can harm the organization's reputation both internally and externally. When employees witness these behaviors, it can lead to dissatisfaction and disengagement, reducing their commitment to the organization. This can result in decreased productivity, lower morale, and difficulties in recruiting and retaining talent.

To address these issues, employers should:

Implement Fair Policies: It is important to establish clear policies regarding office functions, including access to meals and canteen resources. These policies should ensure that all employees, regardless of their position, have equal access to these resources. Any special menus or benefits should be handled transparently and equitably to prevent feelings of exclusion.

Promote Inclusivity: Office functions and events should be inclusive, and all employees should be given equal opportunities to participate. The goal should be to foster a sense of community and teamwork, not division. Employers should ensure that no employee is excluded based on rank or perceived value.

Hold Leadership Accountable: Leaders should set an example when it comes to using organizational resources ethically. Leadership should not exploit their position to gain preferential treatment in the canteen or during office functions. If such behavior is identified, leaders should be held accountable to reinforce the values of fairness and respect.

Foster a Transparent and Ethical Work Environment: Employers should work to create a transparent and ethical workplace, where favoritism and exclusion are not tolerated. Channels for employees to report concerns or unethical behavior should be made available and actively promoted.

Encourage Open Dialogue: Employers should encourage open communication, where employees feel comfortable expressing their concerns about unfair practices. Regular feedback sessions can help ensure that exclusionary behaviors are identified early and addressed effectively.

In conclusion, using office canteens or office functions to create exclusion or to manipulate access to resources for personal gain is damaging to the workplace environment. Employers should ensure that all staff members have equal access to office resources, including meals and office functions, and should foster an inclusive, fair, and ethical workplace. By doing so, they can create a more cohesive and motivated workforce, which ultimately benefits the entire organization.",1,2024-12-28T04:07:13Z

G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"Using office canteens to create an illusion of superiority and a class system based on who can afford special menus, as well as using the office eatery as a tool for social exclusion, is a deeply problematic practice that can significantly impact the work environment and employees‚Äô well-being.

 Below are some ways in which this can manifest:

1. Creating a Class Divide: If office canteens offer different menus or food options based on an employee‚Äôs position, salary, or status, it can lead to the creation of a visible class divide. For example, if high-level staff members have access to gourmet meals or special dining areas, while lower-level staff members are relegated to basic or lower-quality food, this signals inequality and can foster resentment among employees. This type of behavior reinforces the idea that people‚Äôs value or status within the organization is determined by their pay or social standing, rather than their skills, contributions, or potential.

2. Exclusion and Isolation: When certain employees are excluded from accessing certain meals or eating in designated areas based on their rank or perceived social status, it can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion. This can further deepen the divide between different groups within the workplace. Employees may feel less included in informal networking opportunities or team-building moments, especially if meals or social interactions in the office canteen are important for building relationships and creating a sense of community. Such exclusion can diminish morale and create cliques, which can erode teamwork and trust.

3. Undermining Team Collaboration: A canteen that is used to segregate employees based on their financial means or job titles can hinder the development of a collaborative work culture. If employees from different levels are unable to interact casually over meals due to imposed divisions, it can reduce the flow of communication and ideas across the organization. This separation can prevent lower-level staff from engaging with higher-ups or sharing valuable insights, which can ultimately harm the organization‚Äôs overall performance and innovation.

4. Psychological Impact: Constantly being reminded of one‚Äôs social or economic position within the organization can take a psychological toll on employees. When food choices or access to certain areas become markers of status, it can negatively affect self-esteem, job satisfaction, and general well-being. Employees may feel less motivated to work in an environment where they feel judged based on their salary or rank, leading to decreased morale and engagement.

5. Unfair Power Dynamics: By using the office canteen as a platform for social exclusion, employers or staff with more influence may reinforce unhealthy power dynamics. This can perpetuate favoritism and control, where certain groups have the upper hand in dictating who can access what, based on arbitrary social distinctions. This can ultimately lead to toxic workplace dynamics, where power is used to create divisions rather than foster an inclusive and supportive environment.

6. Undermining Inclusivity: One of the fundamental values many organizations strive for is inclusivity. Using the office canteen to create an exclusive atmosphere, where certain employees are privileged over others, directly contradicts this goal. A workplace culture that promotes inclusivity ensures that all employees feel valued and respected, regardless of their role or pay. When office spaces, such as canteens, are used to undermine this, it damages the organization‚Äôs ability to attract and retain talent, especially those who may feel marginalized or excluded.

To address these issues, employers should consider the following strategies:

1. Promote Equal Access: Office canteens should offer equal access to all employees, ensuring that no one feels excluded based on their salary, position, or social status. Offering a range of affordable meal options that everyone can enjoy, regardless of their financial situation, is key to promoting inclusivity.

2. Foster Social Inclusion: Canteens can be used as spaces for employees of all levels to come together, interact, and collaborate informally. Employers should encourage a culture where employees are free to sit and eat together, regardless of their roles, fostering a sense of community and breaking down hierarchical barriers.

3. Ensure Transparency: It is important for employers to ensure that any special menu options or offers in the canteen are communicated transparently, and that employees feel they have equal opportunity to access them. If there are special offers or menus for specific groups, these should be handled in a way that avoids reinforcing divisions or creating feelings of exclusion.

4. Encourage a Supportive Environment: Employers can use the office canteen as a place to build team spirit and foster support among employees. Events such as team lunches, casual meetups, or employee appreciation days can be organized to ensure everyone feels welcome and appreciated, regardless of their rank or salary.

5. Lead by Example: Managers and higher-level employees should lead by example, making a point to sit and interact with staff from all levels during lunch or other canteen events. This demonstrates that social or professional status does not determine who can share a meal, which can help break down hierarchical divisions and promote equality.

In conclusion, using the office canteen to create a class system or engage in social exclusion is detrimental to both the workplace culture and employees‚Äô sense of well-being. Employers should ensure that their office spaces, including canteens, foster inclusivity, transparency, and equal opportunity for all employees, regardless of their position or pay. By doing so, they can cultivate a more positive, supportive, and productive work environment.",1,2024-12-28T04:01:21Z
G0XUimJbz44,@isatousarr7044,"When employers and staff use office functions such as family fun days, seminars, workshops, conferences, meetings, theme/unit retreats, and other workplace activities as platforms for exclusionary tactics and favoritism, it undermines the purpose of these events and damages the organizational culture. These events, ideally meant to foster unity, skill development, and collaboration, can be manipulated to perpetuate inequality, favoritism, and exclusion, which can erode morale and trust within the team.

Below are some key ways in which such practices manifest:

1. Exclusionary Tactics: Instead of promoting inclusivity, some employers and staff may selectively invite certain individuals to office functions based on personal preferences, status, or relationships. This could lead to employees feeling left out, particularly those who might not be part of a specific social group or favored by management. This selective participation undermines the goal of fostering a sense of belonging and collaboration among all staff members.

2. Favoritism in Recognition and Opportunity: During seminars, workshops, or team-building activities, some employees may receive disproportionate recognition, rewards, or opportunities based on favoritism rather than merit. This could include preferential treatment in promotions, salary increases, or opportunities to attend high-profile conferences or training sessions. Such practices can demotivate other employees, especially those who feel their achievements are overlooked in favor of those with personal connections to management or colleagues.

3. Undermining Merit-Based Systems: Ideally, workplace activities like workshops or seminars should be designed to recognize employees‚Äô hard work, achievements, and professional growth. When favoritism takes precedence over merit, it sends a message that individual effort and accomplishment are not valued as much as personal relationships or loyalty. This can lead to resentment among staff and a breakdown in trust between employees and management.

4. Manipulating Workplace Events for Personal Gain: Some employers or staff members may use office functions as a way to advance personal agendas, form alliances, or reinforce power dynamics within the workplace. For example, management may organize an extravagant retreat or seminar to strengthen their ties with favored employees, while neglecting the broader team. This manipulation not only wastes organizational resources but also creates a toxic work environment where individuals feel their value is tied to personal relationships rather than professional abilities.

5. Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Control: In some cases, office functions are used to create a sense of loyalty by exploiting vulnerabilities, such as giving certain staff members preferential treatment in return for their obedience or loyalty. This type of behavior fosters dependency and compliance, rather than encouraging independent thinking and teamwork. It reduces individuals to pawns in a power play, creating a highly unequal and toxic work atmosphere.

6. Disregard for Employee Rights: When employers prioritize personal relationships over a rights-based approach, they may overlook employees' legal rights or fail to provide a fair and transparent process for promotions, training, or other workplace opportunities. Employees who are not part of the favored group may find themselves repeatedly passed over for opportunities and facing challenges in accessing resources that are rightfully theirs.

The negative consequences of these practices include:

- Decreased Morale and Productivity: Employees who feel excluded or unfairly treated are likely to become demotivated, which can lead to reduced engagement and productivity. This can have a direct impact on the overall performance and success of the organization.
  
- Loss of Trust: Favoritism and exclusionary tactics erode trust between employees and management, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability within the organization. Once trust is lost, it is difficult to rebuild, and the workplace becomes less collaborative and more divided.

- Increased Turnover: Employees who feel that their work and contributions are undervalued or ignored in favor of others may choose to leave the organization. High turnover rates can disrupt operations and increase recruitment and training costs.

- Toxic Work Environment: When favoritism is prevalent, it can lead to unhealthy competition, gossip, and rivalry among employees, further exacerbating divisions within the team. A toxic work environment makes it difficult for employees to work together harmoniously, leading to decreased morale, poor performance, and potentially even legal challenges.

To mitigate these issues, employers should focus on the following strategies:

1. Promote Inclusivity: Office functions should be designed to encourage participation from all employees, regardless of their background or relationships with management. Creating an environment where everyone feels valued and included is key to fostering a positive and collaborative workplace culture.

2. Recognize Achievements Based on Merit: Employers should ensure that promotions, rewards, and opportunities are given based on the achievements, skills, and contributions of employees rather than personal relationships. A clear and transparent system for recognizing employees‚Äô efforts ensures fairness and motivates staff to continue performing at their best.

3. Ensure Equal Access to Opportunities: All employees should have equal access to workplace functions, training opportunities, and career development programs. Favoring a select group undermines the professional growth of others and leads to a sense of injustice. By creating equitable systems for access, employees will feel that their contributions are recognized and valued.

4. Adopt a Rights-Based Approach: Rather than using office functions to create loyalty through favoritism, employers should adhere to a rights-based approach, focusing on treating all employees fairly and upholding their legal rights. Transparency in decision-making processes helps prevent the exploitation of employees and fosters a more just and supportive workplace.

5. Encourage Open Communication: Employees should feel comfortable speaking up about unfair practices or exclusionary behavior without fear of retaliation. A culture of open communication, where employees are encouraged to provide feedback and raise concerns, is crucial to maintaining a healthy, transparent workplace.

In conclusion, using office functions as platforms for exclusionary tactics and favoritism not only undermines the purpose of these events but also creates a toxic and unequal work environment. Employers should strive to implement merit-based recognition, inclusivity, and fairness, ensuring that all employees have equal access to opportunities and are treated with respect. By doing so, organizations can foster a positive, motivated, and productive workforce.",1,2024-12-28T03:58:56Z

G0XUimJbz44,@Embre_2,"The theory i believe regarding work leave is a society-individual interaction theory. If we look through the Maslow lense for a moment, we have our fundamental needs, which up until recently hadnt been met, and still isnt for everyone. Yet what we see is higher sick leave in countries that are the healthiest and richest. When our biological needs arent met, we have a deeply primal kind of motivation for work, which drives us even when feeling bad, sick or just tired. We dont really have an option, as we are dependent on the work to pay just our next meal. In more developed countries, all those needs are met. We have social security, money on a backup account, payed our bills in advance, and the biological/survival part of motivation is almost completely disengaged, as its developed to respond to short term dangers, not abstract long term ones. The richer and more developed parts of the world are hitting a wall, where the self-actualization part is our next goal, and the workplace simply isnt made for it. There is limited self-actualization potential in a factory job, or a call center an so on. We know we arent there to survive anymore, and so there is limited motivation and it feels subjectivly pointless. It doesnt progress us as individuals, it doesnt promote our full potential and it simply isnt alligned with our goals and aspirations. There is a disconnect between the work needed to maintain a high living standard, and what that living standard causes us to strive for.",0,2024-10-09T09:58:23Z

Telus has another service that can offer up a new PRE SCREENED employee who has to consent to a bunch of invasive Telus health stuff to make sure they won‚Äôt cost the company money any time soon, like that employee who took off work for a heart condition but didn‚Äôt follow the low salt diet, or the one who was a recovering alcoholic and got injured at work in an unrelated incident.

50 years of work great ya an asset because your a consumer that's great for society and major corporations. Why because you pay bills.
But the end is you'll die early maybe just before or after you retire.
So what was it all about.
Everything , education , competitiveness, reaching goals and social class.
Mentally you became encapsulated now mentally you reflect and try to reason to justify ya journey. If successful great, if healthy mentally and physically great also.

Your breathing is closely related to the brain [mind] and gives good relief from stress-anxiety.   To relax sit on a chair or lie down, neck straight,  eyes closed  and observe the sensations of your incoming--outgoing breath at the entrance of the nostrils  for  5-10-15 minutes or more. Don‚Äôt fight your thoughts. With daily practice the mind will relax.  No deep breathing needed. Do the practice without any expectations. When taking a walk,  at office, in college, when reading, before sleep etc  observe your breath sensations. Like me, make this a lifetime daily  habit to have a better life. Reduce negative social media  and avoid constipation as it affects the mind instantly. Best wishes--Counsellor.",8,2022-01-03T13:02:13Z

The large builders I work for are all the same when it comes to building in that they MUST make their huge profit targets and more often than not rather than cutting back on waste they will reduce, freeze or hold back payment. last year I was stopped ¬£1100  for no reason at all aswel as being layed off for three weeks whilst waiting for our site to pick up...I never received my payment and had to find work elsewhere and start the stress cycle all over again....

The still, vegetative and animate levels of nature are the only ones in a state of balance, because they have no free choice. They make no decisions as to whether they should behave one way or another, but they behave according to their inborn nature.

We people, however, act according to our decisions that are higher than our inborn nature. We thus use these levels of nature‚Äîstill, vegetative and animate, which are below our human level‚Äîegoistically, bending them however we wish for personal benefit.

We thus destroy and empty the planet, plant life, animals, and eventually also people, due to the egoistic way we relate to each other and nature.

The system we live in was set up so that we reach a state of mutual consideration, encouragement and support. That is the key to entering into a state of balance with nature.

By acting contrarily, with calculations of self-benefit overriding those of benefiting each other and nature, we then knock ourselves out of balance with nature.

Then, we experience this imbalance as suffering on personal, social and economic scales, and also as ecological blows, whether it be earthquakes, floods, wildfires, pandemics and several other phenomena that we call ‚Äúnatural disasters.‚Äù

The more we head into the future without transforming our attitudes to each other and nature‚Äîfrom egoistic to altruistic‚Äîthen the more we will experience our tightening interdependence negatively.

However, if we start relating in a considerate, supportive and encouraging way to each other, then we will see how nature also relates positively to us. Accordingly, we will unlock a new balanced, harmonious and peaceful existence.",0,2023-06-25T18:27:34Z

2. We‚Äôve convinced ourselves that these behaviors are no big deal. It's just one email. But there's a ____________ to these interruptions, and there are smart ____________ we can all take to better protect our time.
3. These moments seem so small at the time, and yet research suggests they add up to a ____________ The constant ____________ of work into our personal lives can increase our stress and ____________ our happiness.
4. So just what is the cost? In one study, researchers ____________ parents who were visiting a science museum with their kids. Some parents were told to check their phone as much as possible; others were told to check their phone ____________
5. They also felt ____________. In another study, tourists who were asked to have their phones out while visiting an ____________ remembered fewer details a week later.
6. And in my research, employees who were paid for their performance spent increasingly less time interacting with friends and family, and more and more time ____________   colleagues and clients.
7. Companies lose ____________  each year to employee depression, which is often caused by the stress and burnout of our always-on culture.
8. Most recently, I found myself texting a client while in the middle of my first ____________  happy client, ____________ mom-to-be.
9. When you add up all of these moments, the sum total is a life ____________ on meaning, joy, connection and even memory. As we remake our models of work in the wake of the ____________, now is our opportunity to create a new culture that respects time.
10. The first step that we need to take is to ____________. Reflect for a moment about what you think about when you hear the word ‚Äúrest.‚Äù Sounds amazing, right? But in my mind, I immediately worry about not being ____________ or letting down my colleagues.
11. When we do have time off, we need to find ways in which we can enjoy the present moment and ____________ the leisure time that we have available, as ____________ seeing it as an unproductive barrier to our work. One specific strategy we can take is to treat our upcoming weekend like a vacation.
12. On Friday afternoon, ____________ how you would act and behave as if you were on a holiday.
13. Or maybe you'll go for a long walk in the middle of the day with no phone and no agenda. The plan doesn't have to be expensive or ____________. Another strategy you can take is to create clear ____________ for your time off.
14. Call me only if it's urgent."" To ____________ these personal goals, work together as a team. Set team goals for personal time.
15. Do it publicly, collect data and hold each other ____________. These goals could sound like, ‚ÄúI will not check email between 6:00 and 8:00pm;‚Äù ‚ÄúI will have dinner with my family four nights a week;‚Äù or ""I will go for a jog ____________‚Äù
16. Lastly, you can negotiate for more time to prevent work from ____________   your personal life. In business school, I teach students to ____________   salary but realize I spoke almost nothing about negotiating for more time.
17. What does this look like in practice? You can ask for more time on ____________   deadlines at work. If your client asks for a deliverable Monday morning, ask for an extension until Tuesday afternoon so you don‚Äôt find yourself working on your ____________   weekend.
18. In my data, employees who ____________   asked for more time reported lower levels of stress and burnout, and were seen as more committed and professional by their colleagues.
19. These are small but powerful changes to not only ____________    , but to reclaim it.
20. Once you discover the ____________   that these changes can have, you‚Äôll feel empowered to demand that others respect and ____________   your approach to time.",0,2022-01-08T15:25:28Z

of regulating their everyday activities, handling everything just in time (with yellings, swearing, and nervosity).

In brief, the ability to relax and distract yourself in your spare time - is one of the real guarantees of your success.

4FT5RYuifwE,@rambo7135,"So this past week i started a new job. I suffer with social anxiety. It was much much worse many years ago but its still there and affects me.

Anyway although i have been trying hard at work to ask questions i was still making mistakes.  This was pointed out to me by the woman who had trained me and untactfully she told mevit was adding to her workload. That made me feel really horrible. And then i started to ask her a lot more questions just to make sure i was clear but this only annoyed her as she told me i should have read her notes. But i did read her notes and they werent making much sense to me.

I just couldn't tell her that as i thought that would make her angry.

Also there was a misunderstanding after asking my boss if i could work from home. I had asked her over Microsoft teams. And the way she worded it made me genuinely think it was ok to work from home.

The woman training me said my boss had told her i was supposed to come into the office the rest of the week and next week work from home. I did apologise and i was genuinely sorry.

Even now its really giving a lot of anxiety! 

Im going to have to quit because i dont feel its working out. It might be a temporary inconvenience but its probably better they find someone more competent.

But mentally- they would run away far from you. And those ""dear"" to you would do everything in their power to stop you from talking about your experience. Because they don't want to associate themselves with a ""fool"". It is completely considered not okay to talk about your mental instability, no matter the awareness campaigns.

It is not even an illness per se. I would say that majority of these conditions are a reaction to the fast-paced, urgency-driven, performance-based, do-or-die, dog-eat-dog world we have come to accept as reality.

QE8kNh52EeU,@isatousarr7044,"Corrupt practices in budget planning, such as inflating costs and staff remuneration, undermine the financial integrity of an organization and create significant ethical issues. These practices not only damage the company's financial health but also harm employees, stakeholders, and the overall workplace culture.

Corrupt practices in budget planning can include:

1. Inflating Staff Remuneration: One common way employers manipulate budgets is by inflating staff remuneration, either by overreporting salaries or including fictitious positions. This may be done for personal gain or to cover up misappropriation of funds. Senior executives or managers might artificially inflate their own salaries or bonuses, sometimes at the expense of others. This creates inequality within the workforce and misrepresents the company's financial health.

2. Falsifying Operational Costs: Employers may inflate operational costs, such as overhead, supply costs, or maintenance, to create room for embezzlement or hide inefficiencies. For example, a company might report higher-than-necessary expenses for office supplies, equipment, or services, allowing managers or executives to divert money into their own pockets.

3. Misuse of Budget Allocations: Sometimes, budget items are intentionally misallocated. Funds meant for essential functions, such as staff training or equipment upgrades, may be diverted toward personal expenses or luxury items for senior management. When critical resources are misallocated, it can hinder the company's growth and employee welfare.

4. Inflating Cost Estimates: Employers may inflate cost estimates for projects, purchases, or services, giving them more financial leeway. This allows them to divert the excess funds elsewhere, often for personal enrichment. This practice is particularly damaging when it affects key areas like healthcare, safety, or employee benefits.

5. Manipulating Profit Projections: Some employers manipulate profit projections to appear more successful than they are. This is done to justify higher salaries, bonuses, or other perks for senior executives, even when the company is financially struggling. By reporting inflated earnings, they can secure larger compensation packages.

Consequences of corrupt budget planning include:

1. Financial Mismanagement: Inflating staff remuneration and operational costs leads to poor financial management, which can have long-term consequences for a company's bottom line. Misallocating resources can drain reserves, hinder growth, and lead to job cuts or scaling down operations. If not addressed, it may lead to the company's collapse.

2. Loss of Employee Trust and Morale: Employees who become aware of or suspect financial manipulation may feel demoralized, exploited, and undervalued. If they know funds are being misused, they may lose confidence in their employer, resulting in decreased productivity, higher turnover, and difficulty attracting talent.

3. Inequality and Unfair Pay Distribution: When remuneration is inflated for certain employees, especially senior management, it creates a sense of injustice among the workforce. Lower-ranking employees may feel their contributions are undervalued, leading to resentment and a toxic work environment.

4. Legal and Reputational Risks: Engaging in corrupt budget practices can lead to legal penalties, such as fines, lawsuits, and loss of business licenses. Additionally, the company's reputation can be severely damaged, making it harder to attract new clients, partners, or employees.

5. Ethical Breakdown: Corruption in budget planning signifies broader ethical issues within the organization. When leadership prioritizes personal gain over employee well-being, the company's culture becomes toxic. A lack of ethical behavior and transparency leads to a breakdown in organizational integrity.

To prevent and address corrupt budget practices, employers should:

1. Implement Transparent Budgeting Processes: Adopt transparent budgeting procedures that are reviewed and verified by multiple stakeholders. This reduces the opportunity for manipulation.

2. Regular Audits and Monitoring: Conduct regular internal and external audits to detect discrepancies in financial records. Monitoring staff remuneration and operational costs can help identify fraud or misconduct early.

3. Ethical Training and Leadership: Provide training on ethical budgeting and financial practices. This helps employees at all levels understand the importance of integrity in financial matters.

4. Whistleblower Protections: Encourage employees to report corrupt practices without fear of retaliation. Strong whistleblower protections and anonymous reporting channels can help expose unethical behavior.

5. Corporate Governance and Accountability: Establish strong governance structures with clear lines of accountability for financial decisions. This ensures that individuals cannot manipulate the system for personal gain.

In conclusion, corrupt practices in budget planning, such as inflating costs and remuneration, pose significant risks to organizations. To ensure fairness, financial health, and trust, employers must adopt transparent, accountable, and ethical budgeting practices.",1,2024-12-28T03:55:27Z

You have a gallbladder for a reason! Don't let them take that thing out. Vitamins A, D, E, and K all needs animal fat to be able to digest and utilize. Why do we all need glasses or at least most of us? Vitamin A anyone? Why do we all have a problem with low vitamin D? Working indoors don't help , however north people lived just as long and healthy. It's FAT! You need to eat FAT! I know K is important to help put magnesium in the bones. Look this shxt up people! Plains Indians , Mongolians , Spartans , Lewis and Clark  and many more all ate 90% meat base diet and fasted. They also ate in seasons as well. Eating carbs around the Fall season to fatten up a little like a bear eating berries and fish. Anyways, off topic . I know some company's install game machines in the break rooms. A little  paddle ball on a longer break like 15 mins would help so much! Maybe a standard 45 min lunch as well. Why not?

FN0_ow76hU8,@Helen_Voskanyan,"Hey, I really appreciate this discussion on stress and burnout. It's super relevant to everything going on today, especially with what the doctor said about how stress is higher now than ever before.
One thing that caught my attention was the statistic about people checking their phones 2,600 times a day. I'm a bit skeptical about that number. Could you share the source of that study? It feels like an incredible amount, and I'd be interested to see the methodology behind it‚Äîlike, was it self-reported, or was the data tracked? I feel like the source matters, especially when we're talking about statistics that make such big claims.
Also, the way she explained the amygdala as the ""reptilian brain"" that takes over from the prefrontal cortex was a super clear way to put it. But it got me thinking‚Äîdo you think that might be simplifying things a little too much? I know it's a podcast and not a neuroscience lecture, but I'm just curious if the actual biological process is a lot more complex than just a simple on/off switch between two parts of the brain.
Anyway, the part about ""toxic resilience"" was a great point. That's a concept I hadn't heard before but it makes so much sense with what's happening in the work world right now. Great video!",1,2025-06-29T02:47:57Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@Louiseclaire64,"I had burnout for 4 years that started in 2020 ( with onset of menopause and pandemic). It started with chronic shoulder pain, and my prefrontal cortex went completely offline. I could not think or  process, had a horrendous memory,  and developed a life restricting sensory processing disorder. i actually wondered if i had the start of dementia. Turned out i had undiagnosed adhd resulting from 50 years of trying to live a 'normal' life with a neurodivergent brain. I got to the point where i couldn't go out and was super sensitive to light and sound and was plagued with migraine. I thought my life was over.   Thankfully i listened to joe dispenza, howard schubiner, and Andrew huberman, norman doige , and learned about neuroplasticity, the mind body connection. This started my journey to reduce stress by calming and regulating my nervous system, and healing chronic pain. I have a new daily routine ( i started 10 new things in a week and I'm still doing it 7 months later). Amazing. I'm 100% better and feel 20 years younger.",0,2024-12-09T11:53:46Z

We need to find out why they are struggling more. Boomers and older people had relatives and parents killed in wars. Some were in wars. And they've lived through everything Gen Z is living through.  They lived through more ""onslaughts"", ""aweful"" experiences and ""collective trauma.""  Younger people are more dysregulated and less resilient.  Finding out why is the only way to help them.  I believe a big part of it is that they are trying to regulate with electronics instead of with others  in person.

We get mad. Anger doesnt pop up and attack us. We choose to get angry. Its our choice.

The question is whether getting angry or stressed in a situation is valid. Most of us just F up our own minds and blame stress as if its an external entity.

These are the key ingredients:

What is most important to you? 

2 changes at a time - 8 weeks 

6 elements of live of lifetime in a day:
¬†¬† Childhood - play
¬†¬† Work - sense of meaning and fulfillment 
¬†¬† Loneliness - alone time
¬†¬† Vacation - do something you love
¬†¬† Family - spend time with loved ones
¬†¬† Retirement - reflect on what worked, what didn't 

Diaphragm breathing, exercise, limit phone time and put it away, healthy eating on time, monotask and remove distractions, therapeutic writing, loneliness is not good, compassion for others (you don't know their battles).",0,2024-08-22T16:23:18Z
FN0_ow76hU8,@Venus-9421,"Practical Tips:
- Set Boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with work and digital devices to help manage stress.
- Monotask: Focus on one task at a time to improve productivity and reduce stress.
- Therapeutic Breathing: Practice deep breathing exercises to quickly reduce stress levels.
- Therapeutic Writing: Use writing as a tool to process and manage stress.
- Social Media Diet: Limit exposure to graphic or distressing content to protect mental health.
- Stay Connected: Prioritize meaningful social connections to combat loneliness and its health impacts.",0,2024-08-22T13:10:55Z
FN0_ow76hU8,@Venus-9421,"Key Takeaways on Managing Stress and Burnout:

1. Widespread Stress: 72% of people struggle with stress, and 70% have at least one feature of burnout.

2. Burnout Symptoms: Modern burnout often includes an inability to disconnect from work, not just feeling exhausted or unmotivated.

3. Delayed Stress Reaction: Stress can manifest after the immediate crisis has passed, leading to increased mental health issues later.

4. Combatting Burnout:
   - Set Boundaries: Limit work and digital device use.
   - Breathing Exercises: Simple techniques like deep belly breathing can quickly reduce stress.
   - Take Breaks: Regular short breaks throughout the day improve productivity and reduce stress.

5. Social Media: Overuse can lead to a ""popcorn brain,"" making it hard to focus. Set time limits and keep your phone out of reach at night.

6. Loneliness: It‚Äôs as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Stay connected with loved ones to improve mental health.

7. Therapeutic Writing: Writing about your stress for just 20 minutes a day can significantly help manage it.",2,2024-08-22T13:06:19Z

I particularly enjoyed the diaphragmatic breathing. I've never wanted to do it, could do it, nor liked it. I think now though I have worked it out and will use it too! It's not so painful anymore somehow. 

Thanks for sharing your real self Stephen and your examples. Immensely helpful to us. Thanks for asking the questions (the dumb ones) that we need to know answers of, to keep following. None are too silly to ask about. Your audience is young and old and it helps someone, many someones Im sure. 
Great book by sound of it, a lived experience and recovery and easy steps to follow convinced me to listen to the end. 

Creative writing and Pre and pro Biotics are on my list to tackle next. I didn't make the connection to the stress if you implement these before today. I'm struggling and this has changed my outlook and given me hope. What a precious lady. Thank you from my heart to the both of you.

2. Work - doing something paid or unpaid that gives you a sense of meaning & accomplishment.
3. Solitude - spend some time alone each day, to reflect and think about things. This is great for mental health & wellbeing, & to boost creativity.
4. Vacation - spend some time in the day doing things you love. Eg: playing some music.
5. Family - spend time with loved ones. If you don't have any, spend it with your community, or even make a quick phone call.

FN0_ow76hU8,@lightlightlight,"Disappointed that she‚Äôs taking credit for the canary in the coal mine in relation to stress and limbic system. That came from the DNRS program and the lady who invented it, Annie Hooper. I have used this phrase for years because of her program which is decades old. I don‚Äôt pretend to have come up with this phrase and always explain where it came from for correct contexts She straight up just acted like she came up with it and made no reference whatsoever to DNRS or It‚Äôs founder. Annie was the one to make this reference as a metaphor for this topic and it‚Äôs actually more nuanced than the way this guest is using it since it‚Äôs stolen. But wow. People love to borrow others ideas and not give credit. Furthermore, by appropriating it she‚Äôs downplaying the significance of those who struggle as genuine canaries in the coal mine. Not just anyone who experiences chronic or acute stress. It‚Äôs not being explained correctly here because she liked the sound of it without truly understanding why it‚Äôs a perfect metaphor for those it‚Äôs really meant for.",1,2024-04-22T00:37:22Z

It took me 1 year of visiting a psychiatrist to be able to fall asleep without medications again. I am still working on it because I only sleep for 3-4 hours per day but I've learned my lesson.

I think you in general are not very transparent about how your guests earn money, and in what way this make stem invested in portraying a certain narrative. We understand the world in stories, and even though this guest is probably well intending, it‚Äôs important to give the audience the ability to comprehend the full picture. That also includes the fact that she is heavily incentivized to create fright over narsisists, to attract people to her channel and keep them engaged. She points out how they can‚Äôt know for sure how many are narcissistic, and tells us about peer reviewed articles pointing to about 1-6%, and THEN goes on to suggest 1/6, which is absolutely shocking to have a scientist make up that number without any backing. This wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem if it wasten for the fact that our minds a biased towards these simple hooks, and what we all probably have stuck in our head now is ‚Äúwho in our friendsgroup?‚Äù.

1. **Rising Stress and Burnout:**
   - A significant portion of the population is experiencing stress and burnout, with 72% struggling with stress and 70% showing at least one feature of burnout.
   - Stress-related issues are prevalent in healthcare visits, and a considerable number of people find it hard to disconnect from work, contributing to burnout.

2. **Delayed Stress Reaction:**
   - The recent years have been notably stressful, leading to a delayed stress reaction where individuals feel the impact of stress after the acute stressor has passed, contrary to expectations of a ""Roaring 20s"" revival.

3. **Burnout Symptoms and Causes:**
   - Burnout manifests through symptoms like anxiety, depression, and fatigue, differing from acute stress in its chronic nature and management by different parts of the brain.
   - Modern stressors are chronic, keeping the fight or flight response active and leading to burnout when the brain lacks rest.

4. **Toxic vs. True Resilience:**
   - Toxic resilience, characterized by productivity at all costs, contrasts with true resilience, which involves setting boundaries and allowing for rest and self-compassion.

5. **Managing Stress:**
   - Recognizing physical manifestations of stress is crucial, as is understanding that stress is a normal part of the human experience, not a weakness.
   - Chronic stress affects the brain's stress pathway, leading to various health issues.

6. **Social and Environmental Factors:**
   - Stress can be influenced by our environment, with factors like excessive screen time and poor dietary habits exacerbating stress levels.
   - Emotional contagion can create either toxic or positive environments, highlighting the importance of the company we keep and our digital habits.

7. **Strategies for Stress Management:**
   - Implementing small, manageable changes in lifestyle, focusing on diet, exercise, and sleep can significantly impact stress management.
   - Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, therapeutic writing, and setting digital boundaries can help mitigate stress.

8. **The Importance of Breaks and Gut Health:**
   - Regular breaks can enhance productivity and mood, while gut health plays a crucial role in mental well-being, influenced by lifestyle factors.

9. **The Dangers of Multitasking and Autopilot Living:**
   - Effective multitasking is a myth for the majority, and living on autopilot can lead to stress and regret. Embracing monotasking and mindful living can counteract these effects.

10. **Loneliness as a Global Issue:**
    - Despite technological connectivity, loneliness is prevalent and has significant health implications, comparable to serious physical health risks.",0,2024-02-10T05:59:59Z

So, is there a way for you to send an email to a subscriber with a discount code for something they would actually use, like food for instance. Could you partner with a grocery chain who would give 5$ off or 10% off there grocery order of 50$ or more . These are just thoughts, maybe this particular strategy cannot work due to you not being able to get there email but then something else has to work. I myself didn‚Äôt join for fear of losing where I was on YouTube with my remote control and also because I actually didn‚Äôt know how to use my remote to find the area where you hit subscribe so perhaps in your dialect you can take a few more seconds and direct people exactly how to do it ? ‚ù§",1,2024-02-02T21:40:10Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@uprightmovement,"To best self-regulate and self-actualize, consider these nervous system resets:

Get Clear on What Matters Most: This involves identifying your core values and priorities, understanding what is truly important in your life. This clarity guides your decision-making and provides a sense of purpose. Techniques like journaling, meditation, and strategic planning can be beneficial in achieving this clarity.
Find Quiet in a Noisy World: Creating mental space amidst daily chaos is crucial for mental well-being. Practices such as mindfulness, spending time in nature, and engaging in digital detoxes can help in finding this quietude. It allows for introspection and recovery, essential for maintaining resilience and mental clarity.
Sync Your Brain and Your Body: Aligning physical actions with mental intentions is vital for overall well-being. Practices like yoga, Tai Chi, or mindful movement not only improve physical fitness but also enhance mental and emotional stability by fostering a strong mind-body connection.
Come Up for Air: Recognizing the need to take breaks for recovery and rejuvenation is important. This involves stepping back periodically to replenish your energy, engaging in hobbies, and socializing. It's also about recognizing the need for mental health days and honoring your well-being.
Bring Your Best Self Forward: Cultivating a state where you operate at your highest potential involves continuous self-awareness, self-care, and personal development. Staying informed, continuously learning, and applying knowledge in both personal and professional life are key aspects of this practice.
Integrating these strategies into your routine can foster a balance that supports well-being, resilience, and longevity, and they can be aligned with a holistic approach that encompasses biological, psychological, sociological, evolutionary, paleoanthropological, and mythological models. They aid in balancing the eternal with the temporal, enhancing both personal and professional life.",0,2024-02-02T20:48:50Z

This is especially important for those who have faced traumatic experiences or high-stress environments, such as first responders, veterans, and anyone in high-pressure roles.

Examples of a Healthy Nervous System State:

Calmness and Focus: Ability to remain composed and attentive under stress.
Resilience: Quickly bouncing back from stressful or challenging situations.
Empathy: Effectively recognizing and responding to others' emotions.
Self-Regulation: Managing emotional and physical responses, especially under duress.
Benefits of a Well-Regulated Nervous System:

Improved Mental Health: Reduced risk of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
Better Physical Health: Lowered likelihood of stress-related conditions like hypertension.
Healthier Relationships: Enhanced ability to communicate and empathize, leading to stronger connections.
Increased Performance: Improved focus, decision-making, and problem-solving skills.
Consequences of a Dysregulated Nervous System:

Health Risks: Elevated risk of chronic stress issues, heart disease, and weakened immune function.
Emotional Difficulties: Greater susceptibility to anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion.
Impaired Relationships: Challenges in maintaining healthy personal and professional interactions.
Reduced Effectiveness: Decreased ability to concentrate, make decisions, and handle tasks.
Cultivating a Healthier Nervous System:

Mindfulness and Meditation: Enhance self-awareness and promote calm.
Regular Exercise: Engage in physical activities, incorporating mindfulness-based practices like yoga.
Balanced Nutrition: Support overall well-being with a nutritious diet.
Quality Sleep: Essential for stress hormone regulation and nervous system health.
Positive Social Interactions: Seek out and maintain supportive relationships.
Professional Support: Consider therapy or counseling for trauma and stress.
Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in psychology, physiology, and neuroscience.
For people like first responders, veterans, and others in high-stress roles, these practices are not just self-care; they're a vital part of maintaining professional effectiveness and personal health. By integrating these habits into daily routines, one can significantly enhance both personal well-being and professional performance. This holistic approach, considering the biological, psychological, and sociological aspects, is key to thriving in both personal and professional spheres.",0,2024-02-02T19:46:40Z

In brief, stuff we know... there's a difference between acute stress that our brains were evolved to cope with and chronic stress that is bad stuff. High levels of chronic stress and burnout are leading to rising mental health problems. (Basically our brain works like a dam and deals well with acute stress but the dam wall cracks when there is constant chronic stress - like a huge ongoing wave of water pushing on that dam wall!) Overworking and lack of balance leads to burnout and affects longevity. True resilience is a gift, but toxic resilience needs to stop (that 'keeping on going despite your body screaming' kind of resilience). The body sends signals for stress through physical manifestations. So stress impacts physical health.  Emotions are contagious and can affect the workplace. Popcorn brain is a biological phenomenon of brain circuitry popping due to overstimulation. Internet addiction and popcorn brain are different, with the latter being ubiquitous in modern life. And popcorn brain keeps us in habits of seeking more stimulation... 
 
Make small changes over time to manage stress effectively. When feeling stressed and in survival mode, shift focus to what matters most and activate prefrontal cortex. Even a little bit of exercise can help manage stress. Emotional and stress eating leads to craving high fat and high sugar foods - it's how our brain/bodies evolved during cave times to survive. Taking breaks [even super short ones, like 2 mins btw meetings and breathing deep) is essential for reducing stress and improving learning. 
 
Eat well! The gut-brain connection is crucial for mental health. (They are treating depressive states through gut health these days.) Avoid high phone brightness, late-night scrolling, and minimal movement. Multitasking is a myth, only 2% can effectively multitask. (TWO PERCENT - that's not gonna be me.) 
 
Using time blocking technique helps in monotasking and reduces stress. Diaphragmatic breathing helps control stress response. Belly breathe again - like babies do. We breath too much in our upper lungs. Therapeutic writing and a whole bunch of other ideas. But mainly she talks about taking a few small steps. Wholesale change will fail. Simple stuff like connecting with people, strangers, taking stock of your day and instilling a media diet (balancing staying informed and mental health), etc. 
 
The podcast really is a good one.... So many good tips and images that explain stuff we go through.",0,2024-01-29T11:11:02Z

Unfortunately I think stress is from the burden that the normal life to achieve success and save up for the future in reality doesn‚Äôt actually exist anymore. Planning to have a stable family and time for balancing your mind and health properly is far more limited. Inflation and affordability to own property for the future is much more farther away to attain. It just can‚Äôt be achieved anymore with low-paying jobs like it did decades ago.

FN0_ow76hU8,@KwipAI,"Burnout insights are eye-opening! üëÄ Here's a sneak peek at 5 of our 14 key takeaways:
    
2. *The Delayed Stress Reaction Phenomenon:* Dr. Nerurkar explains the concept of a delayed stress reaction, where individuals shore up their internal reserves during acute stress periods and only exhibit stress responses once the immediate threat has passed. This phenomenon is currently widespread due to recent global events, leading to increased rates of mental health issues.

4. *Atypical Burnout Symptoms:* A key insight from the episode is the changing face of burnout, with many individuals experiencing 'atypical burnout,' characterized by an inability to disconnect from work rather than the traditional symptoms of apathy and lethargy. This new understanding of burnout challenges conventional perceptions and suggests that even those highly engaged in work may be at risk.

6. *Toxic Resilience vs. True Resilience:* The conversation addresses the concept of 'toxic resilience,' where societal pressures and hustle culture promote an unhealthy form of resilience that ignores the need for rest and recovery. Dr. Nerurkar advocates for a balanced approach to resilience that includes self-compassion and acknowledgment of human limitations.

7. *Generational Resilience Misconceptions:* The podcast challenges the stereotype that older generations are more resilient than younger ones, pointing out that each generation faces unique challenges. The rise in mental health issues among younger generations is not due to a lack of resilience but rather the result of navigating a hyper-connected and often stressful world.

13. *Popcorn Brain and Social Media:* The term ""popcorn brain"" refers to the overstimulation of the brain's circuitry due to constant digital engagement, leading to a decreased ability to focus and potentially increased anxiety. This concept highlights the need for mindful consumption of digital content.

Yes, a canary would stop singing and basically faint and then die, but if taken outside quickly they could survive. Miners would breed canaries or buy them cheaply at petshops (females, mostly, as they were worse singers and went cheap). Later special safe cages were invented that could be made airtight if the bird fainted and oxygen would be supplied into the cage. Again, canaries are unique in their sensitivity to gas.

FN0_ow76hU8,@RoseMadrid-e5t,"‚ô¶Ô∏èTHE GOSPEL OF THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD "" the last age in which God is saving man from the imminent destruction of this old world""
       (At the time Jesus worked in Judea, He worked openly, but now, I work and speak to you in secret. My work among you is closed to others. These words, these chastisements and judgments , is revealed only to you and not to others. These people will soon become perfect after enduring the chastisements, but those outside do not know about it. This work is too hidden! For them, the incarnation is hidden -man of God, but to those in this flow, He can be considered not a secret. The work that is currently being carried out in you and in China is tightly closed, so that they do not know. If they do find out, only judgment and persecution what they will do here. They will not believe it. To make the country a great red dragon, the most backward of places, is not an easy task. If this work is carried out openly, how will they allow it to advance? Can they bear the Does God exist? So My work cannot be seen, known or discovered by unbelievers. So, working stealthily in this way benefits both you and the business as a whole. Everyone will know that there is a group of winners in China; everyone will know that God incarnate is in China and that His work has come to an end. It appears that God is personally doing His work in China and has perfected a group of people as overcomers.)

Almighty God said
       At the time Jesus worked in Judea, He worked openly, but now, I work and speak to you in secret. Unbelievers are completely unaware of this. My work with you is closed to others. These WORDS, these PUNISHMENTS and JUDGMENTS, are REVEALED ONLY to YOU and NOT to OTHERS. ALL this WORK is PERFORMED on YOU and REVEALED ONLY to YOU; NONE of the NON-BELIEVES KNOW this, BECAUSE the TIME has NOT YET COME. These PEOPLE are ABOUT to BECOME PERFECT after ENDURING the PUNISHMENTS, BUT those OUTSIDE do NOT KNOW ABOUT it. This work is too hidden! ‚òÄÔ∏èüôè
FOR THEM, the INCARNATION of GOD is HIDDEN,  BUT to THOSE in this FLOW, He can be CONSIDERED NOT secret. ‚òÄÔ∏è
Although everything is open to God, everything is revealed and everything is revealed, this is only true for those who believe in Him, and nothing is revealed to those who do not believe. The work that is going on with you and in China is tightly closed, so that they don't know. üôè
IF they KNEW ABOUT it, they WOULD ONLY JUDGE and PERSECUTE it. They won't believe it. ‚òÄÔ∏è
To MAKE the COUNTRY of the GREAT RED DRAGON, the MOST BACKWARD of PLACES, is NOT AN EASY THING to DO. IF this WORK is REVEALED, it WILL be IMPOSSIBLE to CONTINUE. This PHASE of the WORK SIMPLY CANNOT be PERFORMED in this AREA. IF this WORK were to be CARRIED OUT OPENLY, HOW would they ALLOW it to go FORWARD? üôè

Wouldn't this bring even greater risk to the work? IF this WORK had NOT been HIDDEN, and INSTEAD had BEEN CARRIED out LIKE in the TIME of JESUS, WHEN He MIRACULOUSLY HEALED the SICK and CAST OUT DEMONS, WOULDN'T it have BEEN ""locked up"" by the DEMONS for a LONG TIME? ‚òÄÔ∏èüôè
CAN they TOLERATE the EXISTENCE of GOD? IF I were to ENTER the SYNAGOGUES NOW to PREACH and GIVE a SERMON to PEOPLE, WOULDN'T I have been CRUSHED LONG AGO? And if that happens, how can My work continue to be carried out? The reason why signs and wonders are not revealed openly is to cover up. SO My WORK CANNOT be SEEN, KNOWN or DISCOVERED by UNBELIEVERS. üôè‚òÄÔ∏è
If this phase of work were to be done in the same way as Jesus' in the Age of Grace, it would not be as strong as it is today. So, working stealthily in this way benefits both you and the business as a whole. When GOD'S WORK on EARTH COME to the END, that is, when this secret WORK is FINISHED, this phase of WORK WILL BE REVEALED. EVERYONE KNOWS there is a group of WINNERS in CHINA; EVERYONE WILL KNOW that GOD INCARNATED is in CHINA and His WORK has COME to COMPLETION. Only then will it be clear to people: Why has China not yet shown a decline or collapse? It APPEARS that GOD is PERSONALLY DOING His WORK in CHINA and has PERFECTED a GROUP of PEOPLE as OVERCOMERS. üôè

FN0_ow76hU8,@DrAnnBlakeTracy,"Of course stress is at the highest rate ever along with all the mental health issues this guest listed! The biggest reason is because of our high rate of use of antidepressant drugs! I will take bets that this doctor, just as the random endocrinologist I called out of the blue 2 decades ago, is completely unaware that one single dose of Prozac given to someone who had never taken the drug before experienced an increase of DOUBLE the level of cortisol (stress) as a result!!! 

I had called the endocrinologist to ask how long the human body can handle having their level of cortisol level doubled on a daily basis. His reply was, ""Whoa! You cannot do that to someone!"" 

I persisted with, ""IF you could double cortisol daily how long can the human body tolerate that strong an impact on cortisol levels?"" 

He replied, ""A month? Maybe two? Three at the most! Why are you asking me this?"" So I explained that is what medical research by the drug manufacturer shows is the result of one single 30mg dose of Prozac. Because Prozac has so many clones I would expect the same from them as they all inhibit the metabolism of serotonin. 

His response was to basically quote his drug rep, ""Oh no, no, no! Prozac is a wonderful drug!""

So I told him I would send him the link to the manufacturer's own study so he could see for himself. The reason he had no idea, even as an endocrinologist who should know before anyone else, was because if a drug company did that research outside of the US they did not have to report the results of that study to health professionals in the US. So Eli Lilly did this most critical study in Italy & therefore did not have to report it to medical professionals who needed it. This is why US doctors are completely unaware of this study,  unless they have seen it on the cover of my book, Prozac: Panacea or Pandora? But this is how medical experts are kept in the dark on such critical information on these SSRI antidepressants.

The information on the Amygdala gland connection to the fight or flight response helps me to better  understand why I was drawn to the study of the essential aromatherapy oils to counter the adverse effects of so many of these so called antidepressant drugs (which are in reality dissociative anesthetics instead) fits perfectly. The aromatherapy oils target the amygdala gland.",0,2024-01-23T17:43:10Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@The-Spotlight-Kid,"Off topic but i heard a scary phrase & felt like sharing some related facts.
 The roaring 1920's was calculated by the real ruling uber-wealthy elite to loan out money for people to start buisenisses & buying anything expensive at mega' low interest rates, when their plan was to later create the Great Dustbowl Depression 10'ish years later when they knew all those loans can be instantly called in under the privately owned ""Federal Resrrve"" central bsnk of America, (started by Nsthan Rothschild in 1790'ish & that fsmily still own 51% of the Builderburg's ""Fed Res"" now & their standard loan's National Emergency clause, saw people who took advantage of the ridiculously low interest rates who bought big expanding buisenisses, mansions etc & took further loans out to expand but suddenly had nothing & were jumping out of their buildings top floors as they & their families suddenly had negative equity, had their buisenisses siezed by the loaning Fed' reserve & had to starve or cue up for free gruel where & if & where it was availsable by charity, but a large %'age starved to death. The depression & the roaring 20's was a ten'ish yr'long single & timed nefarious plan to make the very rich who planned the scam, even wealthier than ever. In the roaring 1920's, everyone was told ""we've never had it so good & any national emergency was seen & told to be a virtual impossibility for the distsnt future, a lie,   both were pre- scheduled for the roaring 1920's to culminate in the 1930'ish instant payback clause. We were told at school that  Farmers (for some weird reason not explained) after generations of farming that stayed in the family, had suddenly forgot or couldn't be bothered  about crop rotatation & caused all the topsoil to be blown away, hence become a dustbowl depressions where crops couldnt grow & animals couldn't graze. Trouble was, it was all balls, Farmers were payed above the normal rates  to destroy their crops, the Predident had to announce on radio why a city's people saw thousands of pigs burnt & destroyed, he announced it as honourable agreement ""because of international stock amounts & trade agreements with other countries"" ..when folk were starving to death, it was all calculated & worked as planned & the Gold Standard was then introduced under Woodrow Wilson who was bankrolled by the Rothdchild's for his successful presidential campaign, his required payback was to introduce The Gold Stsndard, which he passed the bill unchallenged on an Xmas eve where most folk didn't turn up to vote, as they knew would happen so possible oponents to it were not informed or present to vote against it. Then, hoarding gold beyond immediately wareable jewelry was encouraged by the media of the day,  to seem as being traitors to America if you didn't swap it for paper representation.  The Federal Reserve anounced 2 or 3 years ago how they have not had any gold to bsck the dollar since the 1930's, they pocketed the lot, so all those films where Fort Knox was getting robbed or failed in trying to be robbed was based on misinformation, Fort Knox had nothing inside, maybe painted lead,  to be seen as backng the paper dollars folk swapped for gold, which to me means: they had it all for themselves.  The Roaring any- years is always part of a nefarious scheme to eff us over upto 10 yrs later  
Similar thing happened when Thatcher promoted the fact ""we are a nation of house owners"" when mortgages were 2.5 to 3% interest at max' but they knew that 10 years later, the interest rates will be manipulated to rise to 15 or 16% & saw 1 house reclaimed every 6 minutes throughout Great.. (yeah, sure) Britsin as for tried to take extra jobs or pay the very high addidition of that extra interest rate (interest must all be payed before your money actually goes to buying the bricks & mortar in any mortgage so their plan worked & saw another massive wealth transfer to the already  very wealthy.  Don't trust ""roaring yesrs"" it's part of a bigger plan to rip you off or eff you over in some way.",0,2024-01-23T06:19:16Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@SindeePalomino,"Hmmmm, Canaray in the coalmine reference, close?  Experienced miner here: its when the canary DIED that miners knew to evacuate. 
First, canaries are tiny birds and animals that small go from nothing wrong to dying or dead very quickly, within moments for many small birds, they didn't just stop singing. 
Also, canaries only sing in the morning, except for communication chirps or when confined to a cage all the because they're in distress and unhappy though a lone bird learns to quiet down sometimea.  Either way, if the bird chirped all day from distress, when it went quiet it was because it died and if it was quiet, noise would no longer be a good reference then anyway. 
Sorry folks, your grandparents and great grandparents viewed many animals as some countries still do-as nothing more than a ""dumb beast"" whose life meant less than the human lives they saved, as they were used throught all history.  Let's honor the lives all all the men, children and beasts that lost their lives to save the lives that are saved nowadays through better practices from stronger laws born from those deaths. ""All laws are written in blood"" has no truer sense than in the mining industry.  ""If it wasn't farmed, it was mined"".

FN0_ow76hU8,@leoxd7029,"1:48:01 by virtue of my job, I am deeply involved with economics and data. I also know a reasonable amount about history. So I know what I need to vote in order for my country to better next year than it was this year. Because you need economic competence and historical knowledge in order to evaluate policy. But beyond that and beyond what my job entails: why would I pay attention to what‚Äôs going on in Ukraine ? Or Yemen? I am not there. It doesn‚Äôt affect me or my families and it is impossible for me to verify the full story of why what is happening where. Me worrying doesn‚Äôt help any of the people involved in these conflicts. And I would have to rely on hearsay from untrustworthy media channels to figure out what is going on. Why take time out of my day to worry about something that is that useless for me to worry about? Do I wish these people wouldn‚Äôt be killing themselves? I don‚Äôt even think about it if I am really honest. It is Their choice. Not a choice I think is necessary or smart, but it is not my choice to make. Does their choice have ANYTHING to do with my life? No, absolutely not. So why would I worry about something that neither I nor my family or friends are involved in and that I have 0 control over ? That‚Äôs crazy to me that people are willing to kill their own peace and ability to actually do something meaningful with their lives and improve their life and their families‚Äô just to worry about a conflict in a country FAR away, for which they cannot possibly know what actually is really going on because they are not there and all they get from news needs to be verified as it might just be false, that doesn‚Äôt affect them or their families at all. That, for want of a better word, is stupid. It‚Äôs not empathetic, it‚Äôs not solidarity, it is just stupid. Or rather, dumb. Focus on what you can control. Worrying your brains out over a conflict far far away that you have nothing to do with and that doesn‚Äôt affect your life, your family‚Äòs life or even anybody else you know, doesn‚Äôt make you a good person. It makes you a virtue signaling crazy person, seeking easy praise for doing precisely nothing. you‚Äôre just putting on a bumper sticker saying ‚ÄûI stand with Ukraine‚Äú on your car. Great‚Ä¶You‚Äôve done literally nothing. Focus on what you can control. Quit wasting your mental health, focus and energy as well as your sanity and peace on this stuff.

Furthermore, this video was GREAT! These  two individuals were amazing, both very respectful. Great questions were asked and great responses were given.

Capitalism its moving around without any kind of control, adapting to all our intents of escaping it or fighting it while keeping its acumulation of wealth above a countless number of human, animal and plant bodies... and now with AI soon will no longer even need us to consume as its starting to create and engenering other kinds os bodies and minds more adapted to an infinitum circle of consumption. We live in the dark age of the modern age and our bodies and minds are the ones sufering it while our souls are trapped looking at screens and amazon proms. Its so sad. Thanks for another great podcast! I'm an anthropologist living (surviving) in a so called third world country and I get that you that live in a western country don't get it. I understand, as a poet said, that what one cannot see, one cannot feel. So its really hard for westerners to understand that half of the world, the southern hemisphere, its producing food and extracting minerals so the consume chain can proceed and you can keep living the virtual dream.

Social media numbs that, I have developed in a way that I questioned the connection of people, being exposed to so much hate and egoism on the internet.

FN0_ow76hU8,@KiwikimNZ,"I‚Äôm the burnout queen! I have been addicted to stress and being busy since as long as I remember. My recent diagnoses of ADHD at 49, explains some of it, I‚Äôm addicted to the dopamine reward cycle and my life was very stressful, but I had to   keep it together because I was a child parenting my mother, she would guilt trip and was so unstable, flying off the handle at the smallest things. I saw here during a psychotic episode when she tried to kill herself in front of me and my sister and I was in constant fear of her dying. I bent over backwards to ensure she was ok and did everything for her and she took advantage of that. I worked for my mum in a small business she set up, living and working there, so I was working 7 days a week (around 20-30 hours a week)  as well as attending school, which I failed badly. That was the beginning of my addiction to work and felt anxious if I was not doing something if I wasn‚Äôt working. I have pushed myself for so many years and something has to give. I considered myself a very healthy person, never sick and very fit, resilient and motivated. Something had to give, I‚Äôd just finished my third night shift and I was raising three kids as well and it was like my brain just shut down, chronic stress finally won. I had a massive prolonged seizure, never had one before or since, the seizure lasted half an hour and at the beginning I was in respiratory arrest, not breathing for almost 5 mins so I‚Äôm told, my face and skin was black, I was so close to crossing over but something bought me back. The hypoxic head injury knocked me to the point I couldn‚Äôt write down letters or numbers, memory loss, inability to speak sentences I would forget what I was saying, I was so exhausted, depressed, anxious, I‚Äôd fall over and would get very disoriented . It took a long time to recover, as I also managed to sustain multiple spinal fractures when I collapsed. That was 10 years ago, I managed to go back to work for almost 2 years, a few months after my injury, but unfortunately the past 7 years I have not worked, surgeries and pain had really effected me. I always thought I was so much stronger, I never knew I was that vulnerable and I‚Äôm a nurse! I totally neglected myself. Now I feel 70 and I‚Äôm 50. Please don‚Äôt ignore your canary in the coal mine! I did and now life as I knew it is changed. I lived stress, i felt strong and powerful, I got off on it, I didn‚Äôt admit to stress either, I just got on with it, complaining wasn‚Äôt an option and no one would have acknowledged me if I had of even expressed that my stress levels were high. How stupid! I did the big reset and it‚Äôs cost me my career, quality time with my children, the ability to be a functioning and productive member of society, it‚Äôs isolated me and I never go out or do anything anymore I‚Äôm too exhausted or in pain. I lost my will to live for quite a while when I realised I couldn‚Äôt do the things I used to do, it‚Äôs been horrible. Please be kind to yourself, allow yourself time off and rest, don‚Äôt say to yourself I‚Äôll rest when I retire, you may not make it, I don‚Äôt think I will as my health is so bad.

FN0_ow76hU8,@myroieegalitariste40,"I am very interested in mental health because I have issues myself. I started listening to this video because this subject matters to me. And it is well done, don't get me wrong. But I'm now a little frustrated because I have been hearing the same advices over and over again to manage stress : don't stay on screen too much, be mindful of what you eat, exercise, have at least 8 hours of sleep, take breaks, talk to people, go out, meditate, etc etc. And yeah, those advices help to an extent. 

But it seems like the main issue of why people are getting more and more stressed is never pointed out : capitalism. Yeah okay, we can do little things to feel better as individuals. But at some point, we need to have a collective answer to our problems. Because the stress we're feeling isn't something we have total control over. Like ""take breaks"" ? Cool, but what if I can't because my boss won't let me? Exercise? Yeah okay, but what if I can't because I have not enough money/time/energy because I'm poor and struggling to just make out a living? Meditate? Meditation has been prooved to me damagable if you don't do it correctly or if you have specific mental health issues (like ruminations). Don't stay on screen to much? What if it's my job? Have 8 hours of sleep? What if I can't because I have insomnia and no doctors manage to give me a solution yet? Eat healthy? What if I can't because it's too expensive? You get the idea here.

Again, I'm not saying those advices are bad. They /can/ help. They /helped/ me. But I'm tired of hearing the same advices thrown at individuals as if there wasn't a global issue here. It's as if we were all living in a forest in fire and we individualy tried to reduce the heat by faning ourselves and drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated. In my opinion, we need to adress mental health problems politicaly. What can we do /together/ to feel better /together/ ?

You know what helped me more to reduce stress? Community. Giving and receiving help. Fighting for my rights with my fellas. And winning some of those fights.",2,2024-01-18T10:47:36Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@Way_Of_The_Light,"üéØ Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:00 üß† *Stress and burnout are prevalent issues, with 72% of people struggling with stress and 70% experiencing burnout.*
04:15 üìà *Stress is higher than ever, with 60-70% of people having at least one feature of burnout, and it's affecting all age groups and industries.*
11:23 üì± *An inability to disconnect from work, including checking your phone excessively, can be a sign of atypical burnout.*
18:43 üåü *True resilience involves honoring boundaries, self-compassion, and making space for rest and recovery, not toxic resilience driven by productivity at all costs.*
20:35 üîÑ *The rise in stress and burnout is not due to generational differences but is influenced by the hyperconnected world and collective trauma.*
22:49 üß† *Stress can have various physical manifestations, like palpitations, headaches, neck pain, and more. These are unique to individuals and can be seen as their ""canary in the coal mine"" indicating stress.*
23:59 üê¶ *The ""canary in the coal mine"" is a historical reference from coal mining where a canary was used to detect bad air quality. Similarly, people have their own stress signals or ""canary songs"" that indicate stress.*
25:19 ‚öïÔ∏è *It's essential to see a doctor for a full workup to rule out any organic problems when experiencing stress-related symptoms.*
26:30 ü©∫ *Understanding your body's physical manifestations of stress is crucial because these symptoms can serve as your personal ""canary song.""*
30:23 üß™ *The main highway of stress in the brain and body is the HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) axis, which involves hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.*
32:22 ü¶† *Stress is not contagious like a virus, but emotions and vibes can be ""contagious"" in social interactions.*
35:40 üíº *The therapeutic presence in a doctor-patient relationship is essential for better health outcomes. It involves qualities like authenticity, empathy, and making eye contact.*
44:20 üß† *Positive lifestyle changes, even when beneficial, can be stressful for the brain and may not last. The ""rule of two"" suggests focusing on making two new changes at a time for better results.*
45:01 üìä *The ""rule of two"" is based on a study by doctors Holmes and Rahi in the 1960s, which found that accumulating life events, both positive and negative, increased stress levels and the risk of developing illnesses later in life.*
46:53 üîÑ *To make lasting changes, it's advised to implement two small changes at a time, gradually building them into your routine, whether it's lifestyle changes or managing stress.*
48:51 üéØ *The first of the five resets to manage stress is to get clear on what matters most (MOST) to you. This helps shift focus from self-preservation to forward thinking and planning.*
50:24 üåü *MOST stands for Motivating, Objective, Small, and Timely. It's a framework to identify what goals matter most to you, providing a roadmap to follow.*
54:52 üèÉ *Exercise, even in small amounts, can help manage stress. It gets you out of your head, increases self-efficacy, and positively impacts mental health.*
58:33 üì± *Popcorn brain is a term describing the overstimulation and constant scrolling on our phones due to information overload. It's a common phenomenon in modern life.*
01:00:09 üìµ *The goal is not abstinence but creating digital boundaries with our phones to reduce reliance and decrease the number of times we check them, thus improving mental health.*
01:06:16 üöó *The speaker describes feeling in control most of the time but occasionally being in the back seat of life, struggling to regain control, emphasizing the importance of agency.*
01:07:26 üß† *Closing the gap between knowledge and action is essential, and forming habits takes time, emphasizing the importance of small, consistent steps.*
01:09:33 üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è *People should exercise for mental health benefits, not just physical appearance, and even a short walk can have a positive impact on stress and mental well-being.*
01:10:28 üß† *Taking short breaks during the day can help manage stress and boost productivity, as demonstrated by a study from Microsoft Labs.*
01:13:14 üòÖ *Stress isn't necessarily bad; it's about maintaining a balance between healthy, manageable stress and unhealthy stress.*
01:19:36 üí© *The gut-brain connection is crucial for mental health, and focusing on prebiotic and probiotic foods can help reset this connection.*
01:25:11 üì∫ *Watching the news late at night, eating processed foods, and having erratic meal times can contribute to stress and disrupt sleep.*
01:26:43 üß† *Multitasking is a myth; true productivity comes from monotasking, focusing on one task at a time, as multitasking weakens the brain's prefrontal cortex.*
01:27:41 ‚è≥ *Time blocking, like the Pomodoro Technique, involves setting a timer for focused work intervals (e.g., 25 minutes), followed by short breaks, which improves productivity and reduces stress.*
01:29:05 üíº *Multitasking can increase stress and reduce a sense of accomplishment, so practicing monotasking through time blocking is more effective for productivity and mental well-being.*
01:31:07 üå¨Ô∏è *Diaphragmatic breathing involves expanding the belly when inhaling and exhaling slowly, which activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing stress and increasing presence.*
01:32:28 üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Stop, breathe, and be for 3 seconds to tap into the mind-body connection, reduce stress, and improve presence and focus.*
01:37:36 üìù *Expressive or therapeutic writing, where you write about a traumatic event for 20-25 minutes daily for four days, can enhance mood, sleep, and overall well-being.*
01:40:07 üåü *""Live a lifetime in a day"" involves incorporating elements of a meaningful life, such as childhood, work, solitude, vacation, family, and retirement, even briefly each day, to feel fulfilled and avoid the negative effects of hustle culture.*
01:44:11 üì± *To counteract the negative impact of excessive phone use, establish a media diet with time limits (e.g., 20 minutes/day), geographical limits (keep the phone out of arm's reach), and logistical limits to maintain better mental health and reduce stress.*
01:48:56 üß† *Being informed and protecting mental health is essential; seek help if facing mood disorders or anxiety.*
01:49:24 üì± *Hyperconnectivity and overconsumption of news can impact mental health negatively.*
01:50:30 üòû *Loneliness levels are rising globally, and loneliness has significant health consequences, comparable to smoking.*
01:52:08 ü§ù *External appearances don't always reflect internal experiences; be kinder and considerate to others.*
01:54:43 üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Chronic stress should not be glamorized; aim for happiness, fulfillment, and connection in life.*

FN0_ow76hU8,@kincentric,"There is plenty of research on the heart. Heart Math has been pioneering this research for decades. The heart registers truth immediately. It is not intervened upon by the mind. 

Stress is transmissable. We know this through lived experience. We also know this through research in the fields of child development, psychology, and psychonuerobiology. We are affraid to say stress is transmissable due to the fear of creating yet another discriminatory category or actions. Fair concern but truth is needed to co-create meaningful solutions. 

Lastly, you cannot teach a therapeutic relationship. At least not based upon how we educate. Apprentiships are needed to see and experience a theraputic relationship modeled. If you have never explicitly experienced as a part of your culture therapeutic relationships, then you have no foundation in which to operate from. It becomes another check list such as, ""ask patient how their day was prior to giving a diagnosis"". A therapeutic relationship is only so when a healing presence is embodied.

In nature, you experience intense fear but knowing that you‚Äôre not in control of it. In the human world, you‚Äôre fearful and stressed more because you know you should have more control of your stressors (make more money, have more help with your kids, get all your grocery shopping done in one trip and stock up on things you use a lot, put bills on autopay, etc). It‚Äôs stressful because we have too many things to control and stay on top of in the human world and it‚Äôs chaotic, in nature it‚Äôs scary because you know you don‚Äôt have that much control over what happens to you. They‚Äôre stressful in opposite ways but I wouldn‚Äôt say one is acute and one is chronic. You would be chronically stressed out in nature as well.

It worked until it didn't. Many students suffered mental health crisis and carpal tunnel.

During work,  I suffer from burnout but I've given up on the toxic resilience side and started taking breaks after work instead of continuing to practice and learn without any breaks.  When you're sleep deprived you're more confident in saying you don't need sleep or other basic needs but you're just slowly killing yourself.  Sleep and rest is the best thing you can do for productivity for sure and a lot of us are learning to take breaks again and being okay with not being productive. It is hard.

Even though there are breaks between the lessons I do not get a break because there is always something that needs to be done, needs to be solved, colleagues come at you with other topics and information and things that we need to work on. Also I get so many messages that are work related during the day, also during the time at work. Students ask many questions. So, when I am leaving the work I am overstimulated, my brain feels like its going to explode. As a teacher my job continues when I arrive home. So those are evenings spent with work too. After listening to the first 10 or so minutes of this podcast I could relate to so many things. Especially the one about sleep. Since working, my sleep has been the worst. No matter what I do, I just cant seem to improve it and there are so many things running around my head when I get to bed that it is impossible to fall asleep and I wake up during the night and I have to wake up early, which makes me stressed even more.

She is trying too hard to push her ideas and getting shit mixed up and is now saying ""work"" is toxic when what we call work today isnt 1/10th what it used to be nor as dangerous nor with our lives continuing being a major unknown due to food/water shortages.

What was going on was, I was so overscheduled, exhausted, distractable and stretched thin that I couldn't get my assigned tasks done within work hours, so I ended up needing to work late into the night to finish them all, which just perpetuated the problem, as decision-making became impaired. At some point it just became a habit to work all day--including on weekends--so I stopped even trying to have periods of self-care. Obviously there was a lot more going on than I can describe in this comment, but I'd say, if you see an employee/coworker working more hours than expected, don't just assume that is a good thing.",9,2024-01-15T22:44:39Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@jasonoliveira2149,"After a 3 concentrated years of chronic stress (graduating college, moving out for the first time, getting married, starting a new career, buying a house, managing a touring band, renovating our house, marital issues, etc) I began have crippling pain in my side/abdomen. It was so intense that I couldn't get dressed in the morning, shower, eat, or sleep all the way through the night. I lost 25% of my body weight (down to 104lbs) over 6 months and couldn't even work at my office job.

After another 3 years of trying to live through daily crippling pain and seeing countless doctors around the PNW, I finally landed on a GI specialist that happened to be studying the effects of stress and anxiety and it's relation to GI pain. He explained how certain anti-depressants have been seen to help the miscommunication in the gut-brain connection (although doctors don't know exactly WHY yet). We tried 2 different antidepressants (at very low dosage levels) and my pain is DRASTICALLY lower‚Äîsome days non-existent‚Äî and I've gained back half of the weight I lost in the last 6 months. We expect that it will be a while on this medication while my brain trains itself back to a healthy baseline rather than constantly being in fight-or-flight.

Aside from (or possibly a side-effect of) taking the medication, I generally don't let little things bother me anymore and can let things go without stewing on them or catastrophizing. When work is done for the day I genuinely let it be done and will sit and watch a show with my wife at the end of the day and actually let myself get engaged with the story. I've become a better friend to people in general while not letting their problems become my own.

Stress buildup legitimately ruined my life for 6 years. I'm so glad that its effects on our body are finally coming to light.",1,2024-01-15T21:16:34Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@dameanvil,"00:00 üß† Stress is a prevalent issue; 72% struggle with stress, 70% experience burnout features, and mental health problems are on the rise.
01:07 üì± Increased stress leads to burnout, with 60% of burnout cases linked to an inability to disconnect from work, exemplified by checking the phone 2,600 times a day.
02:39 üîÑ The speaker's origin story as a stress expert stems from personal struggle; 60-80% of patient visits have stress-related components.
03:34 üìà Stress is a universal problem, affecting all ages, races, and industries; the recent years have seen unprecedented levels, yet mental health is gaining recognition.
04:29 üåê Current stress statistics indicate that 72% of people experience stress, 70% show burnout features, and the past few years are the most stressful in professional careers.
06:20 üåä A delayed stress reaction, triggered by prolonged stress, explains the lack of celebratory feelings post-pandemic; it manifests in increased mental health issues.
08:39 üß† Stress triggers the amygdala, leading to the fight-or-flight response; chronic stress without relief causes burnout, impacting mental and physical health.
11:23 ‚ö† Burnout symptoms are evolving, with atypical features like an inability to disconnect from work in 60% of cases; recognizing burnout is crucial for well-being.
13:23 üìä Studies suggest 60-70% of people experience burnout, but stigma and changing definitions make it challenging to accurately assess and address the issue.
16:51 ‚öñ Toxic resilience, glorifying productivity at all costs, contradicts true resilience, which involves honoring boundaries, rest, recovery, and self-compassion.
19:51 üîÑ True resilience is a biological gift, adapting, recovering, and growing in the face of challenges; toxic resilience, promoting mind over matter, is detrimental and needs to be addressed.
21:31 üîÑ Generational comparisons on resilience are invalid; younger generations face different challenges in a hyperconnected world, leading to an increase in mental health issues.
22:49 üê¶ The ""canary in the coal mine"" concept is a metaphor for physical manifestations of stress, with each individual having unique symptoms like palpitations, headaches, or gastrointestinal issues.
24:11 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇ The historical reference of the canary in the coal mine symbolizes a warning sign; individuals have their own stress indicators, and recognizing them is crucial.
27:26 üõ° High-achievers may deny vulnerability to stress, leading to burnout; acknowledging stress is a human experience, not a sign of weakness.
29:41 üß† The impact of stress on the brain involves the HPA axis (hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenal glands), releasing hormones like cortisol during the stress response.
32:38 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ Stress is not directly contagious like a virus, but emotional vibes and a person's presence can influence others through hormones and a shared energetic field.
36:23 üëÄ Creating a therapeutic presence involves factors like eye level, body language, and authenticity, impacting the quality of interaction and health outcomes.
39:35 üó£ Authenticity, vulnerability, and the human voice play a vital role in creating connections, making podcasting an intimate experience for listeners.
43:29 üîÑ The resilience rule of two emphasizes how the brain embraces change, suggesting that focusing on a couple of manageable changes can lead to long-term positive transformations.
44:50 üîÑ Positive life changes, even if beneficial, can be a stressor to the brain. The ""Rule of Two"" suggests focusing on two changes at a time for lasting impact on managing stress.
47:05 üîÑ Making small, incremental changes is more effective in managing stress than attempting large overhauls. The ""Five Resets"" methodology emphasizes working with the biology of stress over time.
49:45 üß≠ The first reset is to get clear on what matters most (MOST), using an acronym for Motivating, Objective, Small, and Timely goals. This helps shift focus from ""What's the matter with me"" to ""What matters most to me.""
51:22 üéØ The importance of setting motivating, objective, small, and timely goals to guide efforts in managing stress. Real-life examples demonstrate the impact of such goals on stress reduction.
54:37 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇ Incorporating small, regular physical activities, even just walking, can significantly contribute to stress management. It's not about intense exercise but about consistent, enjoyable movement.
58:33 üçø ""Popcorn brain"" refers to the overstimulation of the brain due to excessive time spent online, particularly on social media. Creating digital boundaries rather than complete abstinence is key for mental well-being.",1,2024-01-15T20:38:58Z

Lemme help to show you how to deal with this better based on what I experienced, or maybe lemme just hear you out and show sympathy to your plight."" 

Example, I got chronic back pain from bad posture as a kid sleeping and sitting at desks with no backs, and many heavy weights lifted so I stretch a lot throughout the day to compensate for it. Someone else with arthritis says, ""agh I have arthritis you're dealing with nothing get over it."" And I responded with, ""good then you know similarly what it feels like. But this isn't a competition. We're both in pain, I'm just trying to do something to alleviate some of it. Sorry that we both have this problem.""

We've built a society that is perfect for one type of person - corporations (thanks Citizens United). Technology didn't bring the promised positives, i.e., better work-life balance and an easier life - it brought the exact opposite.

FN0_ow76hU8,@teacherjosephkuan,"üéØ Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:00 üß† *Stress and burnout are prevalent, with 72% of people struggling with stress and 70% experiencing features of burnout.*
04:15 üìä *Stress levels have risen significantly, affecting people across all ages and industries, becoming a global concern.*
10:29 üö´ *Burnout is no longer limited to traditional symptoms; it can manifest as an inability to disconnect from work, even if you enjoy it.*
18:57 üí™ *True resilience involves honoring boundaries, self-compassion, and rest, while toxic resilience focuses on productivity at all costs.*
21:17 üåç *Generations like Gen Z are not necessarily less resilient but face different challenges, including collective trauma and hyperconnectivity.*
22:24 üê¶ *The ""canary in the coal mine"" is a metaphor for physical manifestations of stress, like palpitations, headaches, and more, which act as signals of underlying stress in individuals.*
28:09 ü©π *Admitting to stress is not a sign of weakness, and even resilient individuals can experience burnout if they don't acknowledge their stress.*
30:10 üß† *Stress affects the brain and body through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to the release of hormones like cortisol, resulting in the ""fight or flight"" response.*
32:22 ü¶† *Stress itself is not contagious like a virus, but emotions and vibes can be ""contagious"" in social situations, primarily through nonverbal cues and the voice.*
36:08 ü§ù *Creating a therapeutic presence involves factors like making eye contact, being at the same or lower eye level, mirroring, and most importantly, authenticity in human interactions.*
43:54 üß† *Our brains can struggle to sustain positive changes under stress, as they perceive even positive changes as stressors.*
45:01 üìö *The ""Rule of Two"" suggests focusing on making only two new changes at a time when dealing with stress or major life events.*
48:51 üéØ *When stressed, it's crucial to get clear on what matters most (M.O.S.T.), setting motivating, objective, small, and timely goals.*
54:23 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Even a small amount of daily physical activity, like a 20-minute walk, can significantly reduce stress and increase self-efficacy.*
58:33 üì± *""Popcorn brain"" is a term for our brain's overstimulation due to excessive smartphone use, often driven by stress and constant information streams. Setting digital boundaries is key to managing it.*
01:06:29 üß† *Stress management requires recognizing when you're in control and when you're not, allowing you to regain agency over time.*
01:07:12 üîÑ *Closing the gap between knowledge and action is crucial for effective stress management.*
01:08:38 üèãÔ∏è *Small, consistent actions, such as short walks, are more effective than ambitious, stressful goals in managing stress.*
01:09:46 üßò *People often exercise for mental health benefits more than physical ones, emphasizing the importance of stress management.*
01:12:49 üß™ *Taking regular breaks, even as short as 10 seconds, can help manage stress and boost productivity by aiding neural consolidation.*
01:26:29 üß† *Multitasking is a misnomer; it's actually task switching, which weakens the prefrontal cortex, affecting problem-solving, concentration, and mood.*
01:27:10 ‚è≥ *In a complex world, it's essential to practice monotasking instead of multitasking for better brain health.*
01:28:08 üçÖ *Time blocking (Pomodoro Technique) helps protect and strengthen the prefrontal cortex by focusing on one task for a set time, leading to reduced stress.*
01:30:38 ü´Å *Diaphragmatic breathing, inhaling through the nose, and exhaling through the mouth slowly can help reduce stress by activating the parasympathetic nervous system.*
01:37:36 üìù *Therapeutic writing, expressing thoughts and emotions about a traumatic event for several days, can improve mood, sleep, and reduce stress.*
01:47:23 üì∞ *Consuming excessive news, stress, and doom scrolling can lead to mental health issues, including PTSD.*
01:48:04 üì¢ *Being an informed citizen is crucial, but setting digital boundaries and limiting exposure to graphic content is essential to protect your mental health.*
01:50:04 üì± *Hyperconnectivity can lead to loneliness, which is associated with various health risks, such as heart disease and a shorter lifespan.*
01:52:27 üíî *External appearances often don't reflect internal struggles, so it's important to be kind and empathetic towards others.*
01:54:03 üåü *Chronic stress should not be glamorized, and finding a balanced approach to stress is essential for happiness, fulfillment, and connection.*

We've been sharing a student apartment since 2021 and it was pretty good in the beginning when I worked from home during the pandemic. Because I took time to have breaks, do some chores and make plans for both of us while he went to classes at university.

But when I got back to office everything went to shit, so to speak. My roommate stays inside of his room all day, he wakes up between 5 to 7PM when I just get back home from work, he lives on energy drinks and take-out, every time the door to his room opens a sweaty smell spreads across the apartment. He gets no daylight or regular exercise. I talked to him about it several times, but it got progressively more difficult to speak when he's being shut in all the time ‚Äì it's like trying to talk to a wall.

I had some compassion for his depression in the beginning, but it started to affect me as well, making me a bad friend who won't tolerate any of his negligence and that's why I decided to look for my own place this year. He knows my decision so it won't come as a surprise when I do get an offer, but I honestly can't wait to move out. I'm sad to say it has ruined our friendship.",0,2024-01-15T09:55:40Z

FN0_ow76hU8,@BoldStatement,"üéØ Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:00 üß† *72% of people are struggling with stress, and 70% have at least one feature of burnout, indicating a significant rise in mental health problems.*
00:53 üì± *Increased rates of depression, sleep disorders, fatigue, and burnout are observed due to higher stress levels, with 60-80% of patient visits having a stress-related component.*
01:20 üîÑ *People experience an inability to disconnect from work, with statistics showing individuals checking their phones up to 2,600 times a day, contributing to a sense of burnout.*
02:24 üåü *Dr. Aditi Naruka's journey as a stress expert began when she, as a stressed medical student, couldn't find help. She became the doctor she needed, uncovering solutions beyond mere relaxation.*
03:34 üåç *Unprecedented levels of stress are observed globally, affecting all industries and demographics. Mental health, stress, and burnout are gaining recognition, breaking taboos in various sectors.*
04:29 üìä *Stress rates are at an all-time high, with 70% of people experiencing burnout, and 72% struggling with stress. The recent years have been noted as the most stressful in many professionals' careers.*
07:57 üß† *The difference between acute and chronic stress is explained, emphasizing that chronic stress, leading to burnout, doesn't allow the brain time to rest or recharge, impacting overall well-being.*
10:29 üíî *Burnout symptoms are evolving, with 60% of cases showing an inability to disconnect from work. Atypical burnout can manifest in seemingly engaged individuals who struggle to unplug.*
11:50 üîÑ *Addiction to work can be a sign of burnout when it interferes with sleep, relationships, and daily life, highlighting the changing face and definition of burnout.*
17:47 üîÑ *Toxic resilience, characterized by productivity at all costs and a mind-over-matter mindset, is contrasted with true resilience, emphasizing the need for rest, recovery, and self-compassion.*
21:04 üîÑ *The societal glorification of toxic resilience, reflected in messages like ""Keep Calm and Carry On,"" contributes to the misconception that dealing with discomfort is the essence of resilience, which needs to be debunked.*
21:58 üîÑ *Resilience is discussed in the context of different generations, challenging the stereotype that older generations were more resilient due to harder labor, with the acknowledgment that each generation faces unique challenges.*
22:24 üê¶ *The ""canary in the coal mine"" analogy explains the physical manifestations of stress. It refers to our body's unique signals indicating stress, like palpitations, headaches, or gastrointestinal issues.*
30:10 üß† *The HPA axis (Hypothalamus, Pituitary, Adrenal) is the brain's stress information highway. Chronic stress keeps this axis active, leading to persistent hormone surges, especially cortisol, causing various health issues.*
32:51 üö´ *Stress is not contagious like a virus, but emotions and vibes can be. The heart's electromagnetic field may influence how people perceive each other's ""vibes"" or emotional states.*
36:23 ü§ù *The therapeutic encounter in healthcare involves creating a sense of equality, compassion, and empathy. Simple actions, like sitting at eye level, can enhance the perceived care and engagement in medical interactions.*
39:35 üéôÔ∏è *Authenticity in the human voice plays a crucial role in building connections. The voice triggers deep-seated instincts from infancy, fostering a sense of authenticity, vulnerability, and likability in human interactions.*
43:29 ‚öñÔ∏è *The ""resilience rule of two"" explains how our brains adapt to change. Positive changes require embracing discomfort twice: first, accepting the change, and second, adapting to the new situation, fostering brain plasticity.*
43:54 üß† *Positive lifestyle changes, such as reducing stress, can be challenging to sustain due to the brain's limited capacity for simultaneous changes.*
45:01 üìä *The ""Rule of Two"" is based on a study by Holmes and Rahi, suggesting that positive life changes also stress the brain, advising to focus on two changes at a time for effective adaptation.*
47:05 üîÑ *In clinical practice, incremental changes by focusing on two aspects at a time are emphasized for managing stress and achieving long-term goals.*
49:05 üéØ *The first reset involves getting clear on what matters most (MOST: Motivating, Objective, Small, Timely) to combat stress and engage the prefrontal cortex for better decision-making.*
51:07 üìà *The stress score helps in the first reset, understanding the patient's stress level, while setting MOST goals (Motivating, Objective, Small, Timely) creates a roadmap for stress management.*
54:37 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Exercise, even in small amounts like a 20-minute walk, has significant benefits for stress management and mental health, improving self-efficacy and reducing anxiety.*
58:35 üçø *""Popcorn brain"" is a term for the brain's overstimulation due to excessive online activity, driven by a primal urge to constantly scan for danger, especially during stressful times.*
01:00:35 üì± *To combat ""popcorn brain,"" it's essential to establish digital boundaries and reconsider the relationship with the phone, rather than seeking complete abstinence, aiming for a healthier use.*
01:04:20 üçî *Stress-induced emotional eating is a biological response; the amygdala, focused on survival, craves high-fat, high-sugar foods during stressful periods. Understanding and managing these cravings is crucial.*
01:06:43 üöó *Acknowledge the struggle with stress but focus on regaining control; practice and knowledge help.*
01:07:12 üîÑ *Closing the gap between knowledge and action is crucial for habit-building and stress reduction.*
01:08:38 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Start with small, achievable actions for stress relief, such as a 5-minute walk, to build momentum.*
01:10:28 üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Exercise for mental health rather than cosmetic reasons; even a 2-minute walk positively impacts stress biology.*
01:12:49 üï∞Ô∏è *Honor breaks in the workday; Microsoft study shows that 10-minute breaks reduce stress and boost mood.*
01:13:57 ‚öñÔ∏è *Not all stress is bad; differentiate between adaptive (good) and maladaptive (bad) stress for a healthier life.*
01:21:33 üçè *Foster a healthy gut-brain connection through sleep, diet, exercise, and stress reduction; focus on prebiotic and probiotic foods.*
01:23:29 üì∫ *Humorous but poignant: The ""30-day plan to maximize anxiety and stress"" involves habits like late-night screen exposure and irregular eating.*
01:27:55 üß† *Multitasking weakens the prefrontal cortex, impacting problem-solving, concentration, mood, and engagement. Monotasking through time blocking is a more effective approach.*
01:30:27 üå¨Ô∏è *Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, is an effective stress reduction technique. Inhale through the nose, expand the belly, and exhale slowly through the mouth.*
01:34:21 üõë *Stop, breathe, be: A quick mindfulness technique to switch from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing stress and promoting presence.*
01:36:29 üìù *Therapeutic writing, expressive writing for 20-25 minutes daily about a traumatic event, has been proven to improve mood, sleep, anxiety, and even increase GPA.*
01:41:16 üåà *""Live a lifetime in a day"": Incorporate elements of childhood, work, solitude, vacation, family, and retirement daily to bring fulfillment and meaning into life, countering the hustle culture.*
01:43:55 üì± *Implement a media diet by setting time limits, keeping the phone away during work, and creating logistical boundaries, reducing stress and enhancing mental health.*
01:46:55 üåê *Consuming graphic content, such as videos and images, increases the risk of PTSD and mental health conditions, emphasizing the need for moderation and awareness in media consumption.*
01:48:04 üåê *Being an informed citizen is crucial, but establishing digital boundaries is equally important for mental health.*
01:49:10 üß† *Overconsumption of news, especially graphic content, can lead to mental health issues; seek counseling if experiencing distress.*
01:50:30 üì± *Excessive phone use contributes to a sense of hyperconnectivity but actual disconnection, fueling a global loneliness epidemic.*
01:51:39 üíî *Loneliness is a health concern, equated to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, increasing heart disease and stroke risks.*
01:52:27 üòî *Internal experiences may not align with external appearances; kindness is vital as everyone is facing unseen struggles.*
01:53:34 üîÑ *Stress and resilience terminologies need reframing; chronic stress should not be glamorized, and a nuanced middle ground is crucial.*
01:54:57 üéôÔ∏è *Empathetic communication is key; understanding the humanity in individuals' work fosters connection and success.*
01:55:53 ü§ù *Feedback is valuable; continuous learning and reinforcing beliefs through feedback contribute to personal and professional growth.*",0,2024-01-15T08:58:05Z

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kajjangalas in the Bamboo Grove. Then the young brahman Uttara, a student of Parasiri[1] went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged friendly greetings & courtesies. After this exchange of courteous greetings he sat to one side.

As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him: ""Uttara, does the brahman Parasiri teach his followers the development of the faculties?""

""Yes, master Gotama, he does.""

""And how does he teach his followers the development of the faculties?""

""There is the case where one does not see forms with the eye, or hear sounds with the ear [in a trance of non-perception]. That's how the brahman Parasiri teaches his followers the development of the faculties.""

""That being the case, Uttara, then a blind person will have developed faculties, and a deaf person will have developed faculties, according to the words of the brahman Parasiri. For a blind person does not see forms with the eye, and a deaf person does not hear sounds with the ear.""

When this was said, the young brahman Uttara sat silent & abashed, his shoulders slumped, his head down, brooding, at a loss for words. The Blessed One ‚Äî noticing that Uttara was sitting silent & abashed, his shoulders slumped, his head down, brooding, at a loss for words ‚Äî said to Ven. Ananda, ""Ananda, the development of the faculties that the brahman Parasiri teaches his followers is one thing, but the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of a noble one is something else entirely.""

""Now is the time, O Blessed One. Now is the time, O One Well-Gone, for the Blessed One to teach the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of the noble one. Having heard the Blessed One, the monks will remember it.""

""In that case, Ananda, listen & pay close attention. I will speak.""

""As you say, lord,"" Ven. Ananda responded to the Blessed One.

The Blessed One said: ""Now how, Ananda, in the discipline of a noble one is there the unexcelled development of the faculties? There is the case where, when seeing a form with the eye, there arises in a monk what is agreeable, what is disagreeable, what is agreeable & disagreeable. He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me, this disagreeable thing... this agreeable & disagreeable thing has arisen in me. And that is compounded, gross, dependently co-arisen. But this is peaceful, this is exquisite, i.e., equanimity.' With that, the arisen agreeable thing... disagreeable thing... agreeable & disagreeable thing ceases, and equanimity takes its stance. Just as a man with good eyes, having closed them, might open them; or having opened them, might close them, that is how quickly, how rapidly, how easily, no matter what it refers to, the arisen agreeable thing... disagreeable thing... agreeable & disagreeable thing ceases, and equanimity takes its stance. In the discipline of a noble one, this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to forms cognizable by the eye.

""Furthermore, when hearing a sound with the ear, there arises in a monk what is agreeable, what is disagreeable, what is agreeable & disagreeable. He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me, this disagreeable thing... this agreeable & disagreeable thing has arisen in me. And that is compounded, gross, dependently co-arisen. But this is peaceful, this is exquisite, i.e., equanimity.' With that, the arisen agreeable thing... disagreeable thing... agreeable & disagreeable thing ceases, and equanimity takes its stance. Just as a strong man might easily snap his fingers, that is how quickly, how rapidly, how easily, no matter what it refers to, the arisen agreeable thing... disagreeable thing... agreeable & disagreeable thing ceases, and equanimity takes its stance. In the discipline of a noble one, this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to sounds cognizable by the ear.",0,2024-04-09T09:34:34Z

And I ask God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, the One who does not die, and I ask God the Great, Lord of the Noble Throne, and I ask His Most Beautiful Names and His exalted attributes, and I ask the Possessor of Majesty and Honour, and I ask God the Compassionate and Benevolent, and I ask God the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth, and I ask God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and I ask God, besides whom there is no god, the One, the One, the Eternal, the Eternal, the One who begets and is not born, and there are no equals to Him. Stop anyone from supporting our Muslim brothers in Gaza and Palestine, having mercy on their martyrs, healing their wounded, and giving them patience. May God grant them victory and relieve them, and the patience of the people of Gaza. Your appointment, God willing, is Paradise, and that He will support our Muslim brothers in every place, and guide every strayer to Islam. Glory be to God, and praise be to Him, according to the number of His creation and His satisfaction. The weight of his throne and the ink of his words. O God, forgive the believing men, believing women, and Muslim men and women, living and dead. O God, may your blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and may God bless his family and all his companions.
- [ ]
- [ ] Glory be to God, the Gaza war was a reason for spreading Islam around the world, it was a reason for introducing the world to Islam, it was a reason for converting people around the world to Islam, and the truth of what God Almighty said when He said, ‚ÄúIt is possible that you hate a thing while it is good for you,‚Äù and the Gaza war was a reason for introducing people around the world to Islam. The truth of Islam and praise be to God for the blessing of Islam and praise be to God for this blessing. May God guide every strayer to Islam and grant victory to our Muslim brothers in Gaza, Palestine and everywhere. May God‚Äôs blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and may God bless his family and all his companions.

May God make this year a good year for our country, the Muslim countries, and the countries of the world, and make it a good year to support our Muslim brothers in Gaza, Palestine, and everywhere.

Oh God, send down soldiers from heaven to support the Muslims in Gaza, Palestine and everywhere. Oh God, the people of Gaza and Palestine were defeated, so they were victorious. Oh God, cast terror into the hearts of the enemies of religion and Islam. Oh God, steadfast the mujahideen in Gaza and Palestine. Oh God, shake the ground from under the feet of the Israeli army. Oh God, send down angelic soldiers from heaven. Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil to support our Muslim brothers in Gaza, Palestine, and everywhere. O God, have mercy on the martyrs of Palestine, inform them, and make them dwell in the highest paradise. O God, heal and heal their wounded, O God, clothe their naked people. O God, enrich their poor. O God, feed their hungry. O God, with their help and patience, grant the patience of the people of Gaza, for your appointment is Paradise. O God, Amen. Glory be to God and praise be to Him. The number of his creation, the satisfaction of himself, the weight of his throne, and the ink of his words. O God, forgive the believing men and women, the Muslim men and women, living and dead. O God, may your blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and may God bless his family and all his companions.

There is no power nor strength except with God, the Most High, the Great. God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs. God takes them with a grip, Mighty and Powerful. God shakes the earth beneath them. God causes the earth to swallow them. God sends down stones from the sky on them. God sends down soldiers from the sky to support our Muslim brothers in Gaza, Palestine, and everywhere. God grants respite and does not neglect. God is victorious. To our oppressed and oppressed brothers in Gaza, Palestine and everywhere, be patient, people of Gaza, for your appointment is Paradise.

O God, may your blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and may God bless his family and all his companions.
The mountains of Yemen will be a cemetery for America and Britain, just as the mountains of Afghanistan were a cemetery for America.

Thank you to the State of South Africa.

fvj7D2DT1JQ,@withfeelingthistime,"Hm. this makes me think about my negative self-talk, adhd, and insecurity. as dr. k described how he views and organizes his week from the big picture, i was also starting to think about my weeks from a bigger picture. it was then that i realized that the big picture view is a place that's really uncomfortable for me. personally, i get weak in the knees and anxious whenever i run into any problems. i usually berate myself over being incompetent, which i learned from my mom. but this ability which i know i possess--reaching into the big picture, is where i felt most vulnerable and attacked. it might be exactly where the culprit lies, in terms of what my insecurity is sourced from, and what my negative self-talk is attacking. the part of myself which goes into the big picture view is worried about being belittled for my efforts at organizing my life, so i back down from even trying. this is the mechanism which my mom would exert control over me--putting down my will and making organizing seem like too big of a task for me. even though she's not here, i default to putting myself down too. it's her signature that she left as i was developing. now i feel like life is out of my control, and my internal will is suppressed in fear that trying at all is dangerous. so with this new insight i'm going to intentionally put myself in to organize my life with my own will, until i bust the thought-patterns which inhibit me.",0,2025-08-19T18:56:20Z

Secondly, usually with work there's a ton of different types of tasks within that role. So if you have a shitty retail job, you can still work on other things on the weekend. Like he talks about doing tedious stuff like that HR training on the weekends, stuff that relates to the job but isn't the same.

We all know this we've all went to school and worked at the same time where none of us had a full day off. And if your job is so stressful or awful that you can't work on or create anything outside of it, like I said, try to get a different job because most people don't feel that way about their jobs even if they dislike it.

This is often not the case since the invention of the division of labour.

Many people choose to take on jobs which offer some time flexibility, (eg:  barista) with very limited income so that they have some time for creative projects. The jobs that are the next tier up, often pay a little better, but you are expected to work 40 hours on one type of work with little self-management.

When the video is a priority, fantastic, I have all the support I need from a client, and the job gets done quicker.

And I get exhausted.

I end up being massively burnt out (and even taken advantage of) when I'm expected to do things that don't fit within the scope of my job.
And when I explain that their expectations are unreasonable, and I need to get paid more or being given more resources, they (understandably) get upset.

Often what happens is that they'll find someone else who they feel is better qualified to do the work, but what usually happens is the pattern repeats itself.

I took that job willingly because I've associated mopping and sweeping with exercise. And just with proffessional life if I become strong enough to handle my job effortlessly, its time to look for a bigger fish to eat. At times this task gets more difficult when children are making more mess or an accident took place but over time I accepted that the responsibility to work is also a part of my responsibility to be a stronger person for the next step in my life. I don't plan to be in hospitality for the rest of my life, so why not turn it into a meaninful story arc. 

Notice how I don't rely on praise from my boss or co workers, external motivation from the pay (my parents do this a lot), or even the time I don't have to wait for to work on my future career.

fvj7D2DT1JQ,@Tabby3456,"Working at fast food does not give you that option.
Mainly because its a job were you're suppose to deliver a service or role and be able to give it consistently and fast.

 Some jobs like doing the dishes in the back is easy; no real rush and you can listen to music and podcasts because no one will see you either than the manager and your co-workers and it doesn't require you to listen to someone else, so what I like to do is just before work like the night of my day off, I would take all the music I like and put it in a collection list and have it on autoplay, then when I goto work and I get put back on dishes; I can simply just put on my headphones, my cleaning gear like gloves and apron and clean away while listening to my favorite music. Because of the simplicity of doing dishes: I can listen to music without impairing my ability to do the dishes.

However if you're a cashier, fry cook, or responsible for making sure the order a customer ordered is right and delivering it to them, you can't just listen to music. You can't hear orders, Customers will complain and then the manager will have to inform you that you can't wear headphones at work or play music, even if you're the only one playing it out loud, because nobody cares about your taste in music. With the flexible scheduling where the employee has control over their own schedule, you can either end up being so overstaffed that the managers just send some people home or understaffed where they have to either close half the store like only allowing drive thru orders to be taken or close entirely and  in instances where the drive-thru is the only thing that's open; now we have even more complaints over their order taking so long to be made.

I don't have much faith in my workplace, Letalone for fast-food employment anymore since work is already draining in of itself and making food really fast seems not only like the most unproductive compared to what I could be doing, but also like an impossibility, considering the fact that the food I usually eat takes more than 15 minutes to make and i find that more enjoyable than whatever I do at work. we're understaffed, and that no one gets paid sick leave so they end up going to work and hiding their illness and bring down an illness onto nearly everyone that works there, and to top it all off: a person in line that is going hangry because he didn't get his order the moment he parked at the window where he would get his meal  .",4,2022-11-30T19:56:45Z

I have experienced the idea that not all work is equal, and that different times and different tasks tend to feel better or worse depending on the combination. I am greatful for having a position at my work that is a bit more freeing to let me reorganize my tasks, although i am not enough so to be able to change on what days i do what tasks. 

For anyone reading that's not in a position to do that, i sympathize and i hope you can view this as a way to look at work or necessary things to do in life outside of work, as this information can still be helpful there. 

Thank you Dr.K and the community. You are all awesome <3",111,2022-11-30T18:52:37Z

> What does work mean?
Something that produces value in the external world. 
Work is heterogenous in nature. Tasks that you like and tasks that you don‚Äôt like doing. 
Some tasks are easier to do at particular times. 
Some tasks you can do at any time, because it gives energy. Even when initially tired.
Some tasks that can make you tired, no matter how energetic you are. 

> Not all work is the same. 
Creative work. Ideating, brainstorming, planning, writing. 
Creative energy battery which regenerates, longer yields in a single session create diminishing returns. 
It can make you feel productive and create energy for the rest of the day. Dr K does this on the weekend. 
Reading on a focused topic where there is curiosity. 
Doing research on something you‚Äôre curious about. 

> Mental composting
Ideas get consolidated through sleep.
If you research something and then sleep on it, the information gets stored better to be of use to you. 
It‚Äôs hard to brainstorm at the end of a day full of meetings. 
Give the mind the time to maul over things. 
Mental composting yields a lot of efficiency if you space out the creative work. 
Being able to execute and write content for a video easily, because of the research that has done several days before it. 
This creates the ability to do a 6 hour task in 3 hours instead. 

> Work the we hate doing
Imagine on Sunday night, that the least favourite tasks were actually taken care of. 
How would that change how you feel about the upcoming week?
It‚Äôs the little time you spend on these kinds of tasks, that can make you feel tired. 
Working 7 days a week can be quite invigorating. Doing some work for next week, can really be invigorating. Taking advantage of the creative energy battery through mental composting. 
The tasks that burn us out, if we actually work at it for 30 minutes the mental resistance is way less. 
What really burns you out, is having to worry about those tasks or expected results. 
Working 7 days a week can be more productive, even though that might sounds unnatural.",1,2022-11-30T18:34:56Z

Thus, increasing the amount of clerical work I'd have to do to begin with. It would cycle like that until I'd just burn out.

Then I realized; this video doesn't apply to people with a regular job. 

Regular jobs have strict deadlines, and usually piss poor management. You couldn't do all the stuff Dr K. is talking about in a regular job. It seems that while Dr K. still works for people to a degree, he has a lot more control over his topics and deadlines, room to stretch, if you will. Not so in most other places.

For me, this way of thinking falls down at the first step because the most work that needs to be done does not always create value. And even then, the value-generating work needed to be feasible is escalateing to the point of impossibly.

My partner and I are coming to terms with the fact that after half a decade of grinding, hard work and forgoing many luxuries, we are effectively further away from even our most conservative goals. And it's because life involves family responsibility work, and medical emergency work, and social work, and trauma work, and unforseen accident work, and global pendemic work, and child care work. You could argue that there is value there, but it is not transferable. 

Hell, I would kill to have time to do something creative, or to take time to learn things that could put me in a better position or to financially benefit from the things I'm passionate about.

O0yxJH2i0DE,@TherapywithouttheTherapist,"I'm not going to name any names... but I have recently started working for a very popular outdoor sporting goods store here in St Louis Missouri. I actually interviewed and was hired for an entity of the store which is through a well-known credit card company to get credit card accounts for this store. I was there through grand opening and got this store going and we became number one in the nation in the credit card department. As soon as this happened they made cuts and since I was one of the people who had the most hours they cut me. The sporting store that this entity was in recognized my accomplishments and wanted to keep me but the only position that they could give me was a cashier's position. I have worked 30 years in retail climbing a ladder so I would never have to be a cashier again. To keep myself from having to find another job I agreed because they said that they would give me full-time with benefits however they have been forcing me to work what they call a ""cashier's schedule""basically having no work-life balance whatsoever. I have been struggling with PTSD and trying to work this schedule has put me in a position of being triggered all day long. I got into therapy but work would not allow me the day off for the only day that I could do therapy so I had to email HR and threatened that they were keeping me from getting medical attention. They allowed me Wednesdays off but they still would not give me a work-life balance scheduling me hours such as 11:00 to 8:00 1:00 to 9:00 sometimes 9:00 to 6:00... I never knew exactly when I was going to be working. I finally reached the point of burnout and had to go on disability. My doctor and the disability program headset restrictions and or stipulations for me to work a specific schedule upon returning to work. My work is not wanting to comply with this schedule. I had to have my doctor and disability program reach out to them again because they were trying to say that they never received this information.

The still, vegetative and animate levels of nature are the only ones in a state of balance, because they have no free choice. They make no decisions as to whether they should behave one way or another, but they behave according to their inborn nature.

We people, however, act according to our decisions that are higher than our inborn nature. We thus use these levels of nature‚Äîstill, vegetative and animate, which are below our human level‚Äîegoistically, bending them however we wish for personal benefit.

We thus destroy and empty the planet, plant life, animals, and eventually also people, due to the egoistic way we relate to each other and nature.

The system we live in was set up so that we reach a state of mutual consideration, encouragement and support. That is the key to entering into a state of balance with nature.

By acting contrarily, with calculations of self-benefit overriding those of benefiting each other and nature, we then knock ourselves out of balance with nature.

Then, we experience this imbalance as suffering on personal, social and economic scales, and also as ecological blows, whether it be earthquakes, floods, wildfires, pandemics and several other phenomena that we call ‚Äúnatural disasters.‚Äù

The more we head into the future without transforming our attitudes to each other and nature‚Äîfrom egoistic to altruistic‚Äîthen the more we will experience our tightening interdependence negatively.

However, if we start relating in a considerate, supportive and encouraging way to each other, then we will see how nature also relates positively to us. Accordingly, we will unlock a new balanced, harmonious and peaceful existence.",0,2023-06-25T18:28:18Z

- Of course you are, because your position in life is to make opposing/radical comments so that people will listen, because you say what most people want to hear.
""because balance is achieved with two opposing forces""
- Genius, absolutely genius ... how does he do it?
""And why should work and life be in opposition""
- Hello! Wake up and smell the roses.  Do you think most people love to work? Do you think most people love their job?  They'd sooner just live and enjoy life.  However, if you don't work, you don't have any money. It's a mundane ritual in the pursuit of gaining the ability to sustain yourself physiologically, to provide safety and then the more stimulating social things in life.
Like a mother who wants to be at home with her children, but can't because she has to work.  That, my friend, are what you call 'opposing forces'.  It's all well and good to be this guru saying all these things and giving these wondering opinions, but I'm afraid in reality, they don't mean a pinch of sh!t to the common person.
""We used to have a thing called duvet days""
- But then he goes on to describe that they are 'constrained' to 5 days a year and that in essence in taking a 'duvet day' is simply delaying the inevitable of going to work the next day, and for the next week, making up for all the work that piled up on the day you were down at the beach.
- Honestly, Simon Sinek makes some brilliant comments, and has some brilliant ideas, but in reality they just don't work and these words of inspiration are actually for those who lack inspiration and will never have it.",2,2021-06-30T09:48:20Z

My last boss let me work mon-thurs, take fri off and work sometime on the weekend with my cleaning contracts. As a single parent I preferred this because I worked evenings and not going in fri meant I could have three days in the week off instead of two because I could go in through the day Sat. My last boss rocked with this flexibility. As long as I got my contracts done by monday 8 am he didn't care when I went in.

Nz9eAaXRzGg,@cbsteffen,"When you have stress so hard to relieve, you feel as if you have a boss with the following conflicts/traits:

-The boss insists you work for 140 hours a week for more than a few years without any days-off. Otherwise, he threatens to kill you for sure!
-Whoever overhears the threat calls the cops, and the cops try shooting him, but every bullet bounces off of him and back at the cops because the boss has 200% armor for flesh and therefore takes no physical damage whatsoever (and therefore also destroys sharp weapons and stingers of stinging insects and even breaks hard, heavy objects and any wild animal‚Äôs teeth and claws). He immediately destroys handcuffs for the same reason.
-Then the cops and neighbors try scaring the boss, but nothing scares him because fury is literally his only emotion!
-When trying to outrun him, he always runs faster unless he gets tired and therefore needs sleep, but he only sleeps for at most 2 hours in every 24-hour period and is a seriously light sleeper, so even the quietest noise ever can wake him, and it takes him too long to get back to sleep!",1,2024-03-21T23:36:23Z

Nz9eAaXRzGg,@huzefahamid9339,"My notes:

1.	If memory and focus aren‚Äôt working how you want them to, it can be stress related.

2.	Stress affects two areas of the brain: the frontal lobe (the area for working memory, keeping emotions under control, goal setting, making plans, prioritizing what to do first, next, etc.) and the hippocampus, which is the core of our memory.

3.	High-stress hormones shrink the cells in the frontal lobe and hippocampus.

4.	The best thing you do for your brain is to be physically active. When we‚Äôre working out, it‚Äôs not just good because our heart starts pumping and we get oxygen to our brain, but while we are physically active, our brain makes growth factor that stimulates the outgrowth of the branches in brain cells. They re-establish contact with each other, maybe even new cells are formed.

5.	It doesn‚Äôt have to be a marathon. Research shows that people who do a brisk 45-minute walk 3 times per week gave a bigger hippocampus than people who only do stretching exercises.

6.	Sleeping well is the second very important thing you can do. Sleep loss is a chronic stressor. Even after one night of poor sleep results in poorer concentration, memory and irritability. During sleep, our brain reorganizes itself: good connections are strengthened, and bad connections are removed. Sleep washes the brain clean of waste products. We need that for a good working brain.

7.	Your brain needs good building blocks, i.e. food. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint which vitamins or minerals are good for your brain, but for a whole eating pattern, it‚Äôs clear that people who eat a Mediterranean diet have a brain for a longer time with better memory and concentration.

8.	A Mediterranean diet is large amounts of fruits & vegetables, fish which provide omega-3 fatty acids (we cannot make them ourselves), other proteins and grains, and healthy fats (olive and nuts‚Äîin some studies, these seem to be the two secret ingredients that keep your brain healthy for a long time). Red wine is not good for your brain!

9.	Meditating is the fourth thing you can do for your brain. Increased scientific research shows that daily meditation can benefit your focus and attention. In a basic way, meditation trains your attention and emotional control. You can start with five minutes a day and see how it goes. You can try it, for example, five minutes daily when you wake up or before bed.

10.	These four adjustments can counteract the devastating effects of chronic stress and make your brain resilient to it.

11.	Nilki built these areas into her routine after getting burned out through work. She feels her brain works well again, maybe even better than ever. And she now knows it‚Äôs perfectly fine to work hard and long hours as long as she takes good care of her brain.

Nz9eAaXRzGg,@suhailansari132,"One of the most effective-proven way to reduce brian stress is through brain conditioning. According to this, whenever you don't feel good or positive due to any reasons(emotional, financial, or any type), just tell your brian that it is the best possible situation that I am into, things can get even worse, I am destined for such challenges or huddles or situations in my life, and that I am required to be happy despite such hardships or setbacks. If you master the art of being happy in any kind of situation, detach your happiness from any achievement or success then you don't feel stress.
Nothing is like stress or happiness, it is our mind conditioning  that perceive any situation or things good or bad and based on that we would be stressed or delighted.",5,2023-03-16T07:04:12Z

To relax sit on a chair or lie down, neck straight,  eyes closed  and observe the sensations of your incoming--outgoing breath at the entrance of the nostrils  for  5-10-15 minutes or more. Don‚Äôt fight your thoughts. With daily practice the mind will relax.  No deep breathing needed. When taking a walk,  at office, in college, when reading, before sleep etc  observe your breath sensations.  Make this a lifetime daily  habit to have a better life.

Shove a tablespoon of food in - check the tests, edit them, check the ones from the previous class. Woke up at 8 am, started work immediately, worked through the breakfast and morning routine and the commute, did double work while my students were doing the tests by checking for cheating, and checking that everything worked on the platform they were working it, and being a tech support at the same time, lunch, then more classes, commute to the second job, a bit easier there, finished at 10-10:30 pm, came home at 11:30, ate, played games for an hour and worked until 2 am...all to wake up at 6 the next morning üò¢

If you ask why I hadn't done the tests earlier... that's because I didn't have time or energy. While my usual Mondays were about 14 hours, I still lost almost every weekend to work and by that time I worked an 18-hour day it was the fourth week without a weekend",2,2024-04-19T18:19:48Z

BpKF-lCxBMQ,@Daydreg,"The issue with the high intelligence quality and quantity is that it comes with a very unique downside. 

You end up skipping the journey and reaching the goal almost at an incredible speed. Very hard but very quick and exhausting on your level of energy and straining on you body. 

You do it couple of times and people take it for granted ignoring all the ‚Äúsuper efforts‚Äù you do and belittle every achievement due to how easy is for you to do it as ‚Äúeveryone is different‚Äù. 

There is nothing different in how to but is different on how hard or easy or expensive that is for yourself, in what do you need to sacrifice in order to achieve it and who do you need to become in order to get it. 

The satisfaction to get the goal disappears when you assess the situation and the reward comes with nothing compared with how much you loose while getting it.

This makes you become alone and not wishing to engage with people as they are lacking essence that you need. You already know the interactions and what they will get you and you can steer any situation in your favor even if being in the wrong. I always win even when I loose. I never failed and almost never suffered the consequences of my actions due to my ability to always fall on my feet while using and abusing others to reach any goal I set up. 

The harsh reality is that I always chose to go routes that people will never choose and get the slight feeling of being alive out of it, learning something that I can not know, and never understood how stupid people can be and fought hard to become stupid myself in order to experience it. 

I discovered people aren‚Äôt good at either being smart or stupid and they lack in both of these manifestations. It got me on a road where making others do what they don‚Äôt want in order to make them better provided a small amount of satisfaction at the expense of my own life and energy. Thing that lately I stoped doing. It‚Äôs stupid to push others to become better even if that‚Äôs good for them unless a choice they make for themselves. 

It‚Äôs time I stop being stupid and it‚Äôs time to start working towards something worthy for everyone.

So here I am asking for help: please provide me with a worthy goal- a purpose that will help you and others in your similar situation. 

A purpose that will make me use my gifts for the good of everyone. Put that goal/purpose in a reply below after liking the comment and once I reach 100k likes I will work towards the most needed goal to happen from all of the comments. 

It‚Äôs time to take action towards what you want to achieve and I will be glad to help you do that . 

1 goal - from 100k likes and comments- a dream will come through and you will participate towards it. 

Many thanks!",0,2024-04-06T03:29:57Z

I Think he fails in the fact he doesn't split burnout up into their two main categories. Mental and Physical burnout.
Mental burnout: Which is his example with talking with issurance and his conclussion of working hard and being invested without being compensated sufficiently i think rings true.
But i think he's wrong concerning.
Physical burnout: Which is totally different, if we take the good doctors own example he can be totally satisfied and happy doing a 30hour shift at the hospital with no burnout. Now try doing that 5 times a week for 1-3-6-12 months and at some point your body will crash and burn without you necessarily reaching mental burnout, you can go around and be extremely fulfilled until one day  your body simply collapses.

the experience gap is a real issue in the medical field. you do a pretty good job in relating to the community, and overcoming that. youre able to be more than what you went to school for. you're not just a psychologist, not just a doctor.

I'd never imagine a certified psychologist saying the stuff you do lol. you are hip and cool, Dr K.

but i do still see in how you talk about these issues, is you do slightly view them in a way a psychologist might. 

you continuing to be a part of the gaming community, being a youtuber. keep doing this. 

the doctor/patient relationship can only go so far, and there's vastly different environments that reveal different things about people.

keep being one of us. go further into this community.

by being 'one of us', its not just to gain a familiarity with your youtube audience, understanding the patient, or anything else, gain experience and become one of us.

BpKF-lCxBMQ,@saladslug7432,"I went through 3 years of nursing school and 1 year of working in the same hospital I learned at just to burn out and can never work that job again. I was in school from 2018-2021 so I was what they like to call a ""covid nurse"" because we were right in the middle of all that. 

I was forced to work with violent male patients even though I explained to multiple people that I cannot because of my mental health history, no one cared. 

I was forced to work in the emergency room, Cardiology and Covid ward even though I explained multiple times that I cannot handle those wards. 

After the oncology opened up again higher ups wanted us to work with one nurse and one helper on a whole ward and take care of 10 patients all on our own. In our country a helper isn't even allowed to measure blood sugar levels. 

The whole time our bosses kept having meetings about staff shortage and limiting the amount of patients we were supposed to take but it just got worse after every meeting. 

I was making 21‚Ç¨ an hour which isn't even considered a small amount here but any other basic job can get you the same or more. 

I don't think more reward would've made a difference for me to be absolutely honest. I might've done it for a little longer but I wouldn't have lasted in those wretched working conditions. So I agree to some degree Reward is important to not burn out but if you're working under hellish working conditions nothing is going to stop you from burning out.",0,2024-03-24T08:46:51Z

I should know - as a person on the autism spectrum whose parents wanted a normal child who could grow up, I've been fired for things like working too slowly over and over again.  I've never seen a work situationwhere the employer has compassion for autistic weaknesses and would be willing to help you implement some of the strategies given - which probably would work if tried. The employer, if your best still is not good enough, will fire you no matter how hard you try and regardless of your circumstances.  The last time I was fired, it was the day before what my employer KNEW was likely my last Thanksgiving with a mother since she was dying of cancer.  
In a way you can't blame the employer.  They may want to tolerate your shortcomings, but they need their business to function well enough to survive in a difficult economy.

As if that isn't enough frequent intentional transfers from facility to facility was my order after having inquired why I'm excluded from previlege and motivational course . Their I develop lack off interest in working ,once best clinician I became the talk of the day and night as absentee ,late coming but otherwise my diagnosis and patient case management remained the best ,some senior doctors in the administration could approach me to work at their private clinics them we disagree with wages and they mark me bad and slightest mistake they serve me with a show cause letter ‚úâ, or even disciplinary measure or even salary stoppages for even a year or 8 months.  I became helpless ,mentally disturbed and some times taken to mental rehab after having developed some drug addiction, khat (catha edulis),I try back working I see my fellow work mate holding higher offices /jobs .I see myself inferior , I have no say in the government as a minority. I have been on antipsychotics ,mood stabilization. I love working but I find coming late or leaving before time due to poor crowd management in an African hospital, overcrowded, no privacy that makes me leave earlier than expected, coming late due to sleep disorder, imay find sleep towards morning, just to arrive late ,then face disciplinary measures harsh ones , being a father of 5 boys and a daughter I feel more depressed some times taking my life or harming those in offices for their irrational, enhumane measures against me despite showing all my mental health records.

So I quickly worked myself up to the position of Head of International Marketing. I ended up working 70 hours a week, then going to the gym, then learning languages and some more stuff. Then we took home two dogs from shelter. Then we got two kids in foster care, because we cannot have kids (gay couple). And on top of that my partner got cancer while his mother was dying of cancer. So I had to work 70 hrs a week from home, taking care of kids, taking care of partner, helping with his mom, walking our dogs, taking care of our apartment... I slept 3 hours a day and only lived on caffeine (my breakfast was red bull with coke and a cup of espresso and my diet throughout the day was very similar) until I completely broke. I started crying in the middle of work meetings and eventually I had to quit. Later it got to the point when I was planning to hang myself but I couldn't do it so once my partner got better I started gathering information about assisted suicide. When it got even worse, I finally reached out. So I'm going to therapy, I'm taking antidepressants and medication for anxiety and also melatonin.

nKI03ncN374,@swaggycow9198,I suffer from major burnout since i finished my exams and during those years i drained myself too much i exhausted my self everyday and had a very low self esteem(for personal reasons). Before covid i used to be a maladaptive daydreamer to escape the reality and be happy and didnt have proper guidance at that time cause everyone was dealing with something so the next year i had to become serious to prepare for my exams after covid decreased rapidly and was completely strict and hateful to myself . Somehow i manged to score 86%(which is not good enough at all for the kind of effort i put as i stopped maladaptive daydreaming that year) eventually just before my exams i started slacking off because i was so tired and done and didnt want to put any effort so i couldnt put more effort into my exams. Few days after my exams my college started and i didnt even have the time to properly recover from all that brutal stress i gave my self and even my parents sometimes. So i just get so scared to even read my books during college because i feel so exhausted and fear if ill not score well but end up average and sometimes fail because i procrastinate out of fear and hoplessness and i highly think due to butnout from previous year from which i didnt get a proper break and not end up scoring good. I want to be better and be smart and improve myself but it seems so difficult that i end up daydreaming and dont get anything done. Small things trigger me like if my friends being annoying or my parents ordering me to study. I realize that i have devoloped and ego so bad and i dont want to but i have this constant fear of people pursuing me as meek and the memories of my school year when i felt so judged and introverted so i end up being very defensive right now. And when my parents tell me study i get very mad because it reminds me of how they were last year and its all getting to me. But i dont want to stay like this i want to become so much better. I want to achieve all the goals and standards i have set for myself and get out of this comfort zone of procrastination and maladaptive daydreaming. And become the better version of myself.,0,2023-12-25T12:55:14Z

I was working myself like a horse, coming home not being able to talk to my family, not wanting to eat after not having a single bite during the day. Then we had a company's audit that we failed. The departments that I oversee all passed. But 2 depts failed badly and the overall score for the branch was just 2% shy of passing. And every senior manager got written up. Why all 3 of us? The response was - we succeed as a team and fail as a team, everyone is responsible. The worse part was that my direst boss knew about the write ups since Monday, but he waited till my day off on Friday and sent me the write up as an attachment to the email with just 3 letters FYI. He knew I always checked emails from home and was always available. I took it very hard. He did not have the guts to deliver in person. It was the last time I checked work emails from home. And they got into a habit to leave me work that needed to be done on my days off, it used to take me a day to catch up after having 2 days off. Now I have a pile sitting there since September, every single document from the days when I was off. I am not doing it. According to my latest feedback I had, my performance was graded as failed.

nKI03ncN374,@Hamdreas,"I have been pushing myself to be a good worker for so long that it now it has just sunken down to a deep depression. I was assigned 2 projects, working 100% on them, and getting the same pay as my colleagues that only had 1 project. Not only 2 projects, but within both projects I am doing more than my normal QA tasks. I am taking place of a Team leader, floorcoach and trainer. I was experiencing burnout so i talked to my bosses and explained that all of the tasks I have are too much and that I do not have time for all of it, causing me major stress and causing me to work overtime everyday including weekends. I am extremely professional and hate to leave tasks behind, so i kept pushing myself until they find a solution. The solution I asked for was to either just leave me with QA tasks even if it meant having 2 projects or putting me on one project only. I warned them, i did, until now 2 months later, still no action taken, I have gone beyond burnout. I am exhausted and depressed and I dont find joy in anything i do. This is not my normal depressions either, this is deep, this deep whole leaves me with negative and suicidal thoughts everyday. Which worries me a lot, I dont tend to act on it, but the thoughts alone are just excruciating. I have now decided I cant take it any longer. But i am not quitting, I have fought myself to misery and i dont want it to be all for nothing. Ill request my doctor a sick leave, for at least one month. They will suffer without me, but i cant care anymore... They will feel forced to finally give me a solution. Never did they pay me extra for everything that i did, never for an extra hour, or for having 5 jobs at the same time. I earn the exact same as the people scratching their balls do, it feels so unfair, that my mental and physical health was the one paying for it. Guys, please put limits on your work, never do more than you are supposed to, they will use and abuse you, specially if you are good.

Since then, it's been quite easy to fall in the trap again but I've been good at resisting. Then I lost my job in 2016 due to Brexit and I haven't been the same since. I've been struggling with settling again in a role. But Covid was the straw the broke the camels back. After losing my job again during the pandemic, I accepted a job I had never done before and I wasn't qualified for, under the promise of being trained and supported. No training or support was given, and I ended up being bullied for my poor performance..9 months down the line, I'm eaten alive by my anxiety, depressed, fragile and emotionally exhausted. I've been signed off for a month by my doctor, the diagnosis is ""reactive anxiety"", I believe she actually doesn't even know what burn out is. I'm not going to work now, I feel guilty as if this was just laziness, it wasn't legit and it's my fault if I haven't been able to develop resilience as usual in the past. I think I'll simply resign, hoping to find the strength to be unemployed for a while without going crazy. I don't have a family to support so I guess it's feasible.

 I lost a will to live, to do anything, I was just a slave of my work, my life. I hated the fact that you have to still live because I didn't see any purpose and sense in it. 
This was caused by working extreme amount of hours, normally 10,11 but sometimes 15 hours a day. It was also caused by complete lack of support from my employer , rather opposite as my workplace culture actually demanded people to work crazy hours (as my boss once asked me ' soo.. you don't work at night but you could'). This should give you rough idea.
Finally by complete accident I changed the departments and now I couldn't be more happy. My free time came back and my will to live with it. I actually even enjoy my life again which I already thought is not possible anymore.

It might also not cure it because the job permanently has really high demands and pressure, so the vacation gives you a nice break but you still go back to the high demand job.",0,2021-12-18T17:03:39Z

I am a general physician from India & working since 17 yrs...
My age is 41yrs...
Initially I was very enthusiastic & very interested in treating patients..
But now since last 5-6 yrs ,I m loosing interest in my work ( because I started feeling that I'm not getting enough money, enough respect in my job..
I like to spend time taking history  , go in details about there illness ,but most of the patient here in India doesn't bother for their health, they want quick fix of there illness, don't want to pay general physician , even don't carry the file ( medical history sheet+ old report) to the general physician. They take files to the consultant or specialist & also pay them huge fee...
So I lost interest in my job & started feeling irritable, not willing to go to clinic,  insomnia,wanted to retire ...
I have seen many psychiatric, but they only spend only 5-10 minutes with every patient & gave me SSRI, SNRI, TCA etc..
Last year during 1st wave of COVID ,I stays  at my maternal uncle's village, away from my own town for 2 months & felt very good for 2 months....
But again after resuming my work I started feeling same symptoms...
Also 8 month back psychiatric gave me etizolam 0.5 mg at night for 1 month with other antidepressants medicine & felt very good..
Now taking..
Tab. Escitalopram 10 mg twice daily..
Tab. Desvenlafexine50 mg after lunch..
Tab. Trazadone 25 mg at bed time...
But more releif with
Cap. Pregabanil 75mg at night ( started 2 week back)..

Burnout is an state of the mind where the brain focus on everything that need to be done for a long period of time, and the moment you take a break the brain just remember everything that needs to be done and drains your mental or physical energy.

nKI03ncN374,@Joraya.,"""Well, I have to work"", yeah, I felt that down to my bones. 
To be honest, I'm not sure if I'm severely burnt out or maybe feeling depressed. I'm just tired, and I mean that literally. I can sleep 10 hours and still be dead tired the next day. When I do have a two week vacation, I tend to - and that is no joke - sleep away the first week, to maybe get things done in the second one, just to find myself shutting out the world (and all the people in it) and to very likely watch movies or read books for the entire second week, without actually getting things done. When people message me it can take upt to a month or sometimes months for me to find the energy to reply. 
As said in the video, it seems really hard to tell apart depression from a burn out, and for me a lot of the issues on both sides fit. And it's not even that I am unhappy or feeling down all the time. I's just this bone deep tiredness that makes me shut out everyone and everything, that may require of me to take action or cope with other people's issues/emotions. And normally after a great/happy time/day, I tend to shut myself away to ""balance"" it out, so to speak. Probably sounds weird written down like this. 
I mean, in my head I know it, but still I need to ask, is that something that I should see a therapist about? Or might a change of job or a longer medical leave help?",0,2021-11-06T22:31:33Z

When I struggle to get out of bed and do the things I need to do, combined with the utter lack of self-esteem and sense of anything, it compounds the burnout and I'm less functional when depressed. 

I'm mostly burned out with being a single mom. I'm fortunate enough when I got burned out by freelancing, I was able to dissolve the business and create a new one that supported my mental health and energy levels better.

nKI03ncN374,@captainwalker,"Great video presentation! Burnout can be on the way to depression. Dr Marks differentiates the two very well. The big issue of course is whether workers need to be on the slippery slope into depression. Some may not know but mental disorders (such as clinical depression) robs people of life expectancy. So if you were supposed to live to 85, you could get 10 years less. 

Workers need to ask themselves serious questions if they score highly one one or more of the three domains of the Maslach. I suggest the following:
1 - Is it me or is my organisation doing this to me? 
2 - Are other people around me burnt out and suffering with other work-precipitated mental disorders (e.g. anxiety disorders, depression, substance misuse disorders)? 
3 - Why have I got to this point? 
4 - How long has all this been going on?
5 - Why have they not fixed the system after so long (because burnout doesn't just develop overnight)? 
6 - How likely are they to fix workplace issues in the next 6 months? 
7 - Should I hold on in this job for 6 or more months? 
8 - I'm not clinically depressed now but what if succumb and develop clinical depression? What would that mean? 
9 - Should I allow myself to be made ill on the job?
10- What should I do next? 

Obviously - I can't answer those questions for each person. Nor can I advise what to do next. But just asking oneself the questions and being honest - is better than not.",0,2021-10-30T21:19:04Z

so when i got a job at an office, i felt extremely lonely coz the work place (my side of the office) do not promote interactions. theres still chatting among my fellow coworkers but because of where i was put, i became distant to them. 
so now, it feels as if i dont exist to them except when they ask something of me which is super rare.

After getting therapy for 3 years and still suffering, I started Transcendental Meditation which has finally stopped my panic attack that has been ongoing for years. Practicing saying ‚Äúwhatever it doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù to intrusive thoughts for 40 minutes each day helps to train the brain to let go of upsetting thoughts the rest of the time. Medication is a band aid and not a solution. If you want to improve depression and anxiety for real, you have to make actual life changes as you say in the video.

It's becoming more apparent that most of us don't get a job because we won't to, we do it so we can eventually do the things that actually stimulate and make us happy... 

But we can't do that when we're teetering on the edge of bankruptcy 
And the risk of being homeless, or not being able to support our family's 

It's no wonder why we're depressed.. we live in a society that feeds off of it - 

If we all just did what makes us happy, then everything would be different...

I was giving  so much to my company ... waited 2 years for a raise and only got .19 cents for a annual  raise is straight  up DISGUSTING!!!  I hated going there  every  morning... I would simply be on autopilot... I didn't feel  present  at all.... I did feel depressed  when I was there ... I looked forward  to the weekend... but that happiness  was short lived  because  on Sunday  I dreaded working  on Monday.... it's crazy how you give so much to these companies  and they only give you  pennies... I'm tired  of letting  someone  dictate  my self worth.... I was fired for being late because  i  hated coming there... when I say late I would be there like 10 to 15 min late... lol .. the office didn't have any windows ... the sky could've  been falling and u would  known it ... the environment felt like it was sucking my soul .... the work wasn't  fulfilling  at all... the hardest part is reprogramming  your brain.... I keep telling myself ... my  self worth  is not tied to that company... I was never  going to be there long enough  to retire anyways .... so move on an be seek happiness  with a different  company.... it just feels  crappy because  I didn't  do it on my own terms ... but that's ok .... life moves on ... wish me luck on finding  my next job üòÅ‚úåüèæ,8,2021-08-15T06:49:10Z

I started looking for another job but wasn't finding one for over a year. After leaving that job it took me 2 years to feel better. Things in my personal life were going so much better than before so I was feeling great on the weekends but at work, the dread of being overworked and feeling frustrated and not appreciated was making me angry on top of feeling depressed at work. The work itself was fine, I loved what I did (I'm a designer) but my boss kept taking away things I loved doing and giving me responsibilities I hated doing and I told him that but he didn't want to do the things he was giving me and I was the employee so I had to do them, then having to always fix my coworkers work was so frustrating too. Things weren't like that before her and for some reason my boss let her walk all over him. She was older than us and he said, well I was raised to respect my elders (she was our parent's age) I said, ya me too but you're still the boss, you're in charge, not her. He just never put his foot down with her, I suggested he give her her own work to fix and he would on occasion but most of the time he'd just give it to me and I already had enough to do on a regular basis. She was slower at doing things so he was like, just fix it, I need it fast. This constant interruption made it hard to do my job, I had to mentally flip between things all the time and I would lose the image in my head I was trying to create and for an artist, this is the worst thing you can do to them. You can't always get the image back and then what you create turns out differently than you originally imagined it, oh so frustrating. He wasn't an artist so he didn't get that. The technical stuff he did in the office was something you could put down and pick up anytime but our work wasn't like that. His interrupting me to fix her stuff made me more inefficient and frustrated. Anyway, ya 2 years to recover from my burnout feeling. I had been in toxic work environments before this job but I never felt burnt out, it didn't affect how I felt on the weekends or at night but this job did. The only reason I felt ok the last year I was there was that I met my husband and we'd spend weekends together since we lived an hour away and traffic in our area was horrendous (bay area)...he kept me sain for that year but after leaving I can't believe how long it took for me to feel like myself again.",1,2021-07-11T02:42:53Z

I dont know anymore i have nothing to think about  because i dont have any intrest in my stuff before . I dont feel like i used to  , i wanna come back as how i used to feel and im a still young like 14 so i have no job or school work to stress about since i study well.

nKI03ncN374,@GAMAYUNIEL,"This really enlightened me, it explained so much. I tend to burn myself out with art commissions and it really does feel like depression because I've been drawing my whole life and not drawing makes me feel so empty inside. But when I take a break and play video games or get into a new tv series I feel so much better, just guilty that I'm not drawing. So then I feel like I need to force myself and then the burnout drags on. Now I understand that I have to find a better balance when it comes to freelance work with my art. This only started happening when I was able to support myself financially with my artwork so maybe commissions are just not a fit for me, and my art is more of a personal thing.

I have received my autism diagnosis not long ago, and have been reading/watching a lot of online content on that topic. One aspect particularly resonated with me: autistic burnout, as I feel the ""burnout+depression"" diagnosis I received a few years back was an autistic burnout, as described in some youtube videos. However, with online content, I'm always asking myself: Is this a real thing? As in: Are the observations and the advice given there scientifically sound and statistically speaking helpful, or are they hear-say, anecdotal and circumstantial?

I have great trust in your content, as it is very similar to the psycho-education I received after my burnout. So I would very much appreciate your explanation of autistic burnout (if it is a thing) and possibly: coping mechanisms.",0,2021-06-08T08:33:26Z
nKI03ncN374,@soundslike1life,"First time I have seen your videos, and really like how you present things, so looking forward to watching more. 

I'm definitely depressed but burnout has also been a factor in getting there, as there has been a big conflict between my personality and the type of work I needed to do, ventured there due to no jobs on my own field and then, got stuck there. I've had a hellish few years with my health: exposure to toxins in an ill office building that started an army of symptoms that took years to get over and it all started eating my endurance under pressure/stress... then several people dying, 11 relationship ending suddenly, my dog dying, then another abusive relationship with a narcissist who completely destroyed me by gaslighting and future-faking and traumatizing me to a point that all my childhood trauma resurfaced and I fell into depression. I wanted nothing more than to just die. But I got into therapy instead. I am still very much in recovery, especially because when I was somehow ready to enter normal life again, covid-19 happened and I was thrown back into isolation, after already being in self-isolation for couple years due to depression... all of this reduced me to a mere pale reflection of who I am. I lost all my immense creativity and drive, I still feel constant fatigue. I barely recognize myself and I need to rebuild my life bit by bit, but it's been an uphill battle with all these things coming at me all the time. I just feel like I can get no break whatsoever. As a cherry on the cake few months ago my spinal disc bulged out into the spinal canal and I've been in pain and on the verge of losing function on my leg... dreadful pain for several months but the leg is fine now... but I may still end up on an operating table because things are very unstable... So yea. I had burnout, at the very beginning. But now it has been full-on depression for years. During the burnout, at the very beginning, in addition to burnout symptoms I also had physical symptoms that indicate I was already close to depression (stomach issues, feeling very anxious about even going back to work etc, followed by irregular sleeping patterns and constant fatigue). Even my thyroid went nuts due to the exposure to toxins at the work place, permanent sinus damage, three new allergies. It was hell even before I fell into depression but depression is so much worse... you just lose your will to live. I prayed in my bed at night that there would be a pill that I could swallow that would just end it all. I consider it a miracle that I am still here.",0,2021-06-08T06:23:04Z

My husband has some serious health issues, that mean he can't help out around the house or do any day-to-day errands on any regular basis. This means I have to do them, or they don't get done; everything from paying bills to grocery shopping to arranging his appointments and prescriptions, everything seems to be 'my job'. My only respite is an hour's walk everyday, where I mostly sit on a bench and get some fresh air.
Add to this a sense of 'my life is going nowhere'. Husband and I have been unemployed for a long time, like 13 years. And while he seems happy to sit on his backside, I'm itching to do things. He says I can get work anytime, but he doesn't see the barriers that I do. 
He's been telling me 'we'll move home next year.' for about 5 years, nothing ever happens. My entire life has ground to a halt, it feels like there's nothing I can do about it. We've never been on a proper holiday, not even on honeymoon (been married 9 years).
I'm bored, frustrated, burned out and burdened upon. My husband's complacency just seems to make me feel worse.

As someone who has dealt with anxiety and depression in the recent past I was really concerned about possibly falling back into depression. But I had inkling that it was more of a burnout.  I reached the cynical phase with my job back in November when I almost booked a lead on a major network show which of course fell through. I've been in the industry for 15 years and it is highly stressful at times. On top of that with the pandemic and being on unemployment I am constantly stressed about whether or not I am going to be able to afford to pay rent, buy food or basics for myself. And in January I cut off a frenship of 26 years that had turned out to be very emotionally draining and toxic for me but I feel as if I am grieving all these things as well. So it would be really interesting to know if it's possible to have multiple things trigger these burnouts. I am just grateful that it's happening now during the pandemic when I am forced not to work as opposed to me having to go in perform for people all the time while I'm feeling drained. After watching this I feel pretty confident in knowing that I am simply burnt out and not depressed. I love these videos thank you",0,2021-03-06T00:50:47Z

nKI03ncN374,@christyevershappily4eversafter,What do you do when your burned lot from your family and have taken steps to manage burn out but it‚Äôs just not enough.  For example I got a week away from my family and it was wonderful.  On my drive home I felt the exhaustion and dread coming back. I ended up getting a flat tire On my drive home.  I was actually happy about the flat tire because it gave me an excuse to get a hotel room for another night so I could stay away just a little while longer.  When I did get back home the exhaustion and burnout were as if I had never left.  My husband has been helping with taking over dinner. And other things like that.  He‚Äôs helping but we do have past issues that I‚Äôm having trouble getting over. And the burn out from other areas of family life are still too much. I have 3 teenagers all with major problems  and am the only one to be there for my aging mom who refuses to hire help. I‚Äôve had a lot of losses and negative  life changing experience over the last 20 years on top of that.  I‚Äôve reached a point of life burn out.  I can‚Äôt abandon my  family and I can‚Äôt keep putting things and responsibilities on my family members.  I truly feel stuck.  I don‚Äôt have the money or good enough insurance to afford therapy.    The only thing that makes me feel better is being away from my family and yet I love them and can‚Äôt abandon them. I have a travel business and getting away for my business is the only escape I have to make me feel happy.,0,2021-02-06T16:50:31Z

nKI03ncN374,@ilovemybeard3394,"I don‚Äôt suffer from depression, but I will tell you what real burnout feels like when you work at a high stress job or in other words a toxic work culture

‚Äî You want to clean your room, but your body tells you no

‚Äî Your car has trash, and you say ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù I will do it later

‚Äî You have conversations with yourself, and you are your own therapist when you feel detached

‚ÄîYou start to think people don‚Äôt like you and isolate yourself

‚Äî Your body becomes real heavy and all you can think of is sleeping, but you start to have pounding headaches

‚Äî You start to watch motivational videos and you‚Äôre like ‚Äú Yeah!!! I‚Äôm going to do that‚Äù  but you don‚Äôt 

‚Äî Energy drinks or Coffee is top priority and lots of it...LOL  but? There is a cost when it wears off by the end of the day

‚Äî You cry when you feel everything is hopeless üò≠üò≠üò≠ because the cycle continues 

‚ÄîYou start to think in your mind on how to make more income and get out of the toxic work culture,  but you can‚Äôt right now because you have to have a backup plan



There is more, but hang in there guys...a high stress job has its benefits üí∞ 

But your health is more important than money any day...I know it sucks and I have been there

take care guys and hang in there",0,2021-02-03T03:18:26Z

I'm a creative, but my mother convinced me that business was a good carrier choice. I knew from the start that I didn't want to do business, I don't see myself doing any of that once I graduate. I just thought I can get the degree, make my mom happy and then do what I  wanna do.
Now though, I feel myself spiraling more and more into hopelessness and dread. I've lost any and all motivation to do anything. I can't eat without overeating (I don't think I've ever been fatter), but then sometimes I don't wanna eat at all. I can't sleep most nights either (I can maybe sleep for one or two hours, but that's it), but then sometimes I can sleep half the day away.
I knew this wasn't depression. I've had depression on and off for most off my life, so I knew I wasn't feeling that. Then I started looking for psychologists in my area and came across an article detailing the effects of burn-out, which lined up with what I was experiencing.

A hard day goes on until 9:30, where I immediately have to join the next class meeting. I haven't been doing my work in that class. I get on my phone, I can't bring myself to engage with the class. At 11:00, I get a 30 minute break, but it feels like nothing. At this point in the day, I haven't ate yet. I still don't have time to eat, so I have to go through my 3rd class hungry. Maybe it's an easy day and I just have to log on and listen to the teacher, maybe it's a hard day and I have 2-3 quizzes. Then the last class. The worst class for me. At 1:30, I go to Spanish class. I can't bother to try and understand another language. My brain is fried at that point. I feel awful. I try not to cry for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and at 3:00 I close the laptop.

Also, it isn't just school. It is like if I have to do anything in my life and I can't just relax and do nothing, I start to get stressed and anxious and burnout. This is where I start to feel a more general hopelessness as if no matter what I do, I can never be content. I am always just going to suffer unless I am able to remove responsibility from my life which isn't possible.

* The way to reduce burnout is to either change the environment or the individual
* To cope with the work setting, set time boundaries. Don't be infinitely available.
* Prioritize sleep
* Exercise
* Meditation. Headspace. 

* Consider changing companies or jobs",55,2020-08-07T18:52:47Z

nKI03ncN374,@BKLNHobo,"Thank you for this.  I was starting to feel crippling burnout earlier in the year (a mix of a long commute and a toxic and isolated office environment) to the point where I would consistently oversleep, and feel like I had to physically drag myself to work each day.   I was trying to figure out how to address it with my employer by advocating for a partial remote schedule when the pandemic hit.  Once allowed to work from home full-time due to the shelter-in-place mandates, my overall mood and attitude to my work improved significantly.  Now forced to return to the office, my anxiety levels are suddenly back up, and I'm having mood swings, episodes of sleepless and diarrhea, plus brain fog on the days I have to go in.  It's becoming pretty clear that a minor adjustment in my schedule isn't going to fix this, and I need to find a long-term solution in the form another job.",16,2020-08-03T14:21:30Z

There are people who don't have any food to eat and they aren't depressed or burned out. The entire narrative is that you are the problem, because you can't change your work environment. The truth is we're ""treating"" people instead of society and the culture of work itself. Humans aren't made to live in the societies we've created and their organizational structures. That's where all the work of psychologists and sociologists should be focused, not the individual. Socioeconomic activity needs an overhaul.

I have a question.
Let me just fill you in a bit.
I have BPD PTSD, OCD, ADHD DYSLEXIA + ASD
my life has been upside down for years, 2013 to now has been the worst but since June 2018 i have been moving from place to place it is now almost April 2019.
I found a place/room for rent its 95% private.
The lady i rent from has BPD as well with a bit of  Schizophrenia and multiple personalities
(Im guessing, its just obvious)
I'm ok if I'm left alone and that's what i want bcuz I have many irons in the fire, im trying to get a lot of things done that are time sensitive, & all are due at the same time and more keeps pilling on. I have not had time to be depressed, so i feel awful & zone out alot, that is waisting time.
I do have meltdowns due to too much going on & is so overwhelming but i have to keep going.
Well i feel I have burnout, im getting headaches, im tired, i can't sleep good up on & off even with xanax. I dont eat right, i cant think, My financial situation has changed along with just moving here. Her rules changed so its like living with my mother, that's where the PTSD come in play.
There is more but let me get to my question.
Because I have burnout & want to be left alone, just stay in my room and sleep because i have that going on, the lady i rent from says that I'm effecting her bipolar & I'm making her feel bad...
Could that be?
And
How can that be?
I need help & your advice would be great.

nKI03ncN374,@khaledtaleb7191,"Hi Dr.Tracey, am really confused about my status and hadn't any an accepted explanation until this moment. Ok, when I was 11 y/o, my father died and we moved from a country to another .. a New life, new place and new society .. Everything and my whole life changed within few days .. Years go and go even with my bad feeling - I can't describe it but I only can say that I have it, in every part of second in my day and we only separate when am sleeping , otherwise it is with me every time and every where  - but I was coping well because I was thinking that it is with everyone and it is normal -. However,  year by year I became recognized and understand that there is something abnormal and am differ from others and I started be more aware about the changes of my mood pattern and compare myself to others

 Even though, I didn't seek for any medical or psychological or even family attention .. Then, I became medical student and started looking for any corresponding for my symptoms to any medical or psychological diseases .. I spent two years doing that , then I had a severe depressive attack that pushed me to meet a psychologist.. Whatever, I diagnosed with a moderate PDD - dysthymia - two years ago, I didn't remember when was the last time that I wasn't have this feeling. But am sure that it is more than 8-9 years and could be more longer. ( I can't remember anything about my childhood before I lost my father, I don't know if I was like now, or just everything started after him). I didn't become better with the CBT and I avoid starting the medications. 



Today am 23 y/o and upon my memories I can say that , I spent 18-17 years feel like there is nothing real in this life, I doing things just because I have to do it , and I do it just to try to convince myself that I feel it. Couldn't have any emotions with anything, no sadness no happiness no hoping, just nothing and nothing , just feel like emptiness. 

Going in this life with mind only and without anything else. It doesn't matter if life ends now or at the end of the day or tomorrow, not waiting for anything. This was a detailed history about my background so you can imagine and realised my situation.



My question is do you ever see a case like this, do you have any DDx and Could I have another psychological illness combined in the same time with persistent depressive disorder ? I hope you answer these questions in a video, it will be better .. Finally, Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è",0,2019-03-15T21:08:42Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@mariajessicasusilo5162,"This just kind of open up my mind to what it is like in othee countries, their struggles and all, esp the very expensive rent. 

I honestly dk what to say as someone who works 1 full-time job and 5 other freelances... well, I come from a SEA country where the full-time work is never 40hrs, at least it'd be 45hrs/w , usually 50-60hrs/w on full-time only, which I know could be unhealthy. So 40hrs/w sounds like a dream to us coming from this type of culture, but seeing the people that lives in different system struggles that much might mean something is wrong with the system as they have to really work so hard just to have a decent living.

For anyone wondering, I am a Gen Z, yes, a sandwiched Gen Z (surprise) born in the 2000, I work in retail fashion head office, and do graphic design, fashion styling, makeup, tattoos, and social media marketing both freelance and my own property rent. On weekdays I woke up at 5 & do house chores & get ready, leave at 8, work from 9 to 7/8ish, back home at 9ish. Start my side jobs at 10ish usually, finish at 12-1... and the offline side jobs I do on the weekends (as usual, starting and ending the day with house chores and workouts). I def wont do all the jobs all day, I will always have designated time for all of them, some I def can do remotely. But yea things are manageable here, BUT AGAIN, we are raised this way, it's been this way ever since us SEA people were very young...",0,2025-09-25T10:51:41Z

He didn‚Äôt teach me to network, he didn‚Äôt teach me to find ways to get my job done more efficiently, he didn‚Äôt tell me that my life outside of work was actually more important than my job (in my opinion, when you realize this, it helps you to let go of anxiety related to work performance), he didn‚Äôt tell me that I should communicate my goals to my boss, he didn‚Äôt really have any conversation about work ethic with me beyond just ‚Äúwork hard‚Äù.",0,2025-09-24T12:39:03Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@VeggieSlayer,"Im not sure if i agree with the points you mentioned in this video, there is a lot of nuance in what youre saying, which im sure you know and you generalised a lot of information here. When you work X amount of full-time hours a week and you work in an environment where your worth to the employer is based on how much of a favourite you are to the people that make decisions, who hire people and decide the strategy, AND then the environment is toxic with bullying and you get professionally penalised for speaking up about being bullied and alienated. that is exhausting, and it can be outside of your control. Add onto that the frustration of applying for jobs in a desperate attempt to get out yet you keep getting rejected, that is more exhaustion.

If she had said ""I studied x"" or ""this is my formation"" then sure. She's blonde, she's pretty, she lives in the US, she knows how to talk and in my opinion that is reason enough to work towards a decent job. I'm also blond and was raised with a lot of privileges and didn't waste that, now having a great job as an engineer.

Dr K used ""entitled"" in that that's what boomers will say about this generation, what some of the reaction probably was to the video he had shown. He's saying we're called ""entitled"" because we were told the lie ""just work a little harder and things will work out,"" that all we needed to do was find some job and be loyal to that company and we'd see raises and promotions. So we were lied to, and when we say, ""this isn't what I expected,"" we're called entitled.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@Salmiak,"15:30 I am a Millennial with parents born in the early sixties. I don't think they were lazy necessarily, but I think that the baseline of effort has shifted to a ridiculously high expectation. So their effort was a ""normal"", liveable effort, while our generation has to do SO MUCH all at once, just to keep our jobs - let alone stand out. An example: I work in education in Europe, and having worker's rights is already so much more alleviating than the American system, yet I am tired too. In the 1970s/80s, you could get away with just teaching from one book as a teacher - now you have to use all the digital products available, be aware of MUCH more things like differentiation, and come up with more activities in your free time. I'm happy that education is transforming, but the pay no longer matches the skill and effort - and on top of that, housing is incredibly more expensive than it used to be. We cannot afford a house even though my partner and I both make an alright amount of money and work our asses off. It's no wonder my entire generation is burnt out.",1,2025-09-08T05:36:15Z

People know wealth isn‚Äôt just about ""innovation,"" ""smarts,"" or ‚Äúhard work,‚Äù luck is potentially the biggest variable (where you‚Äôre born, what information you‚Äôre exposed to, what systems you land in).

We live in a world where SINGLE INDIVIDUALS could solve world hunger with only a portion of their wealth, but their assets just keep getting fatter.

And you don‚Äôt even have the time or energy to relax and do something you enjoy at the end of the day to make it somewhat bearable. The worst kind of suffering is suffering without a reason.

I have almost the same financial situation as her, but mine is student debt instead of rent. I‚Äôm lucky to be able to live with my parents or I‚Äôd be homeless. What I realized after a while of job searching was that it was unlikely that I was going to find a job where I was paid well. So really the only other factor I could control to make myself happier at work was the environment. Stop looking for the highest paying job and start looking for the one with people you can tolerate and work that doesn‚Äôt completely drain your soul (which doesn‚Äôt mean you have to love it, just not completely despise it). I think the people you are with are the more important part of that equation - the right people can make even the worst job bearable. 

What‚Äôs really giving me /purpose/ though is working on getting my dual citizenship in the EU. In four years, I can be out of here if I put in enough effort to learn the language and get the proper paperwork, due to my ancestry. I‚Äôve already had to hire a lawyer to get one of the pieces of paperwork I needed, which was expensive and stressful, but after getting that court order, I felt so proud of myself, and it renewed my energy and commitment.

Of course we are drained by the use of technology but the problem is mostly that young people think that things are given no effort required. At the age of 25 I moved to anothe country with my boyfriend and a suitcase. We worked terrible jobs. We were renting just one room in a dirty stinky house. We bought our property in 2016. I think after a couple of years of dead end jobs I decided that's it. I need professional career. So I was doing shiity jobs and I studied. Yes I cried over the books sometimes. But after several years of climbing up the ladder I do not cry anymore. These days I still study I never stopped learning. Now I do it from my own nicely decorated home office. People say I was lucky. All these people did not lift ther finger after finishing school. All you need these days is a strategy for technology use. Remember if there is no entertainment your brain would prefer to study than be bored. Yes. Your brain may even prefer unpleasen experience rather than no experience. You just need a few days. Just sit and stare at the wall for a moment if you have to do not switch on TV or pick up your phone that's all. It is about the stories we tell ourselves. Stop thinking that your extra effort is suffering because it is not. Stop imagining that watchin TV would be nicer than learning something new. These are lies. Just examine this really. What sort of things are you telling yourself. Good luck everyone who put away their phone. You'll find joy and purpose I assure you.,1,2025-08-21T13:47:51Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@ryanburchett8455,"Most of the time, I think these videos are great. Sadly, the economic analysis is totally inadequate. I have a background in economics, and I promise you that optimization isn't remotely close to the whole story. 

Maximizing profits is an old explanation based on the rational actor concept. Deeper studies confirmed that companies seek monopoly power over short-term profits. Wal-Mart was one of the first to be studied this way. Corporations also employed other alternate strategies to gain more power. Collusion to act as a cartel, which is a group of companies acting collectively as a monopoly, is illegal but common. Think of the rent ""optimization"" software that actually legally mandates, through contract law, its subscribers to charge prices they recommend. They use the data to corner the market and collectively raise pricing. Legal battles were fought, but corrupting forces have prevented legal action (in this instance) thus far. 

Price discrimination is also illegal and common. Think of 'deals' offered to buy more product at different price points. Consider ticket sales at different times, approaching date of the event. Amazon and other companies are now engaged in what they call ""dynamic pricing."" ""Dynamic pricing"" already had an economic term to describe it, though: it's called price discrimination. Even worse are the data mining operations that monitor your metadata. That's some scary stuff. You think Amazon knowing your purchasing habits is bad? (It really is.) Consider the possibility of metadata from your mouse clicking habits predicting a future disease and selling that to insurance companies who will eventually use that information to deny you coverage when you are in the hospital and can't work.


Ultimately, these are all policy choices, including the decision not to enforce policies that exist on the books. The reason new consumer and employee protections aren't legislated, or enforced when they do exist, is simply corruption. Politicians, judges, police, etc. are bought off in one way or another. No rich genius figured anything out that we didn't already easily understand as children: these people don't play fair. It's not your fault. It is the responsibility of these people not to behave like sociopaths. There has never been so much wealth and power for them to share. But, they would rather be greedy, evil monsters than help you or compensate you even remotely close to the value your labor created.",1,2025-08-16T17:38:37Z

It helps you understand why taxes and bureaucracy destroy real wage growth along with causing social entropy and decay as resources are squandered and parasitized.

You talk about hyper optimization as if it's the cause and not a symptom. Imagine if every day 10% of your food was stolen and there was nothing you could do about it. You would have less wiggle room to experiment or even to just relax and recuperate. Now think about that happening to an entire society and you can better picture the problem.

For understanding it even more there's reading ""What Has Government Done To Our Money"" and ""Democracy: The God That Failed"". There's also the very short read of ""The Anatomy Of The State"".

First and foremost - rent. Make it so you don't pay more than 1/3 of your salary. You might have to live with roommates, and better look for a private landlord. Avoid housing companies. Keep in mind that everyone around you is trying to manipulate you to give your money through different forms of marketing. Enjoy not giving them that. Don't subscribe to services. Look for free, open source if it's digital or used if it's physical. Thrift stores are your friends. Eat whole food plant based (you can quickly cook and combine stuff like grains, lentils, tofu and frozen greens and it's cheap, use soy sauce to make it tasty).

Track your budget in a libre office spreadsheet. Look what expenses are non-essential and can be reduced (you don't need to buy coffee every day for example). After you start saving money and build an emergency fund, you can figure out what amount a month you can spend to treat yourself. And also what your future goals are.

By doing all this you also reduce your participation in the capitalist system that relies on you spending as much money as possible.",0,2025-07-15T13:14:53Z

It's because the problem - having to work for so long just to have basic shelter etc - is a POLITICAL problem. Dr. K. has the tools to help us manage the world *as it is*. You have to look elsewhere to find out how to actually change the working conditions. There are many incidences in history where people, facing similar odds, have absolutely switched the working conditions to a track where progress and improvement for standard of living is possible. I say this as a 42 year old who experienced such poverty as a child that I lived in a tent and spent some years as a homeless young adult. Survival mindset is a real thing and sure, we can all do it, but I would argue that you need to also trust yourself to find ways to change oppressive systems - not only adapt to living within them. If our ancestors had not done this, we would never have had weekends or primary education for our children. It's not wrong to continue to expect good living conditions! It's just not helpful to think it will happen without actually doing something about it. It's absolutely vital that we continue to stand against poor working conditions and unfair systems. It's unreasonable to expect Dr. K. to have the solutions for this, but he hints at it if you listen. GO AND VOTE but also write letters, send emails, sign petitions (all these things *do* work but only if you actually do it), stand up for each other in unfair work environments.

And I want to say that with the caveat that everybody situation is completely unique and there's not one right answer for everyone. Just a couple thoughts that came to my mind as she was talking, she mentioned having a two-bedroom apartment. To me that sounds like a potential opportunity for her to sublease the apartment and get a roommate that can cover half the bill. If she has someone that is able to cover half the bill then she will be able to save that $1,000 a month and possibly free up some time to be able to go on a vacation,  take some time off for hersel, and get a chance to decompress. The other thought that came to mind is well she's in a two-bedroom apartment. Maybe she needs to downsize to a one-bedroom apartment, or maybe even a studio apartment short-term so that long-term she can be set up better financially to be able to take a breath. The other option is just putting a little bit of extra effort in the short term to find an apartment that's more affordable so that long-term, she's able to have a little bit more peace of mind.

As all foreigners here I work a lot more than 40h/week, in these days I work 15h/day (obligatory) and I don't even have time for sleep, I basically rush to home to take a shower and sleep 4.5-5 hours and wake up to repeat all these to reach the weekend. I see my girlfriend only 2 days a week, and also the money I get is not even good enough to say 'oh yeah, if I continue like this I will be rich someday' I basically can save 50% of the money I got and it's always less than 1000$ and what do you expecting me to do with that money? I was thinking that I can save some money and quit my job or switch to part time and during this time period do some self development but I think I didn't build for that, I have no good qualities about it, I can't be consistent, I get unmotivated so quickly and the funny thing is that I know what I am doing wrong but I can't stop it. I'm sure that a lot of people here have even worse cases than me, that's why I try to be patient and grateful for the opportunity I have here, because in my country some people have the same lifestyle and they cannot even save 300$ a month.

You may not become a millionaire by working hard only but you will be successful. Im 40 with no higher education and am underpaid but I made 75k last year. I come to work and I work. You won't believe the amount of kids I see come in with absolutely no motivation to work hard. They get upset when you just look at them sideways. They're on their phones all day. I mean all day. 
We've been looking for months for people to take in and you are absolutely correct in saying g companies have figured out the lowest amount they can pay. We start around $20 and hour but so does Quick trip. We are a precision machine shop and we cant even pay more than the convenience store down the road. I mean qt makes a TON of money but still.
That being said a 19 year old starting at 17 an hour is pretty good money. 

I think a big part of the problem is we see so many fake rich and even rich young people who got lucky and think well I should have that too. 

Plus at the beginning she was talking about expenses. Rent phone and internet which 2/3rds of that didn't exist when our parents were young. They had rent and utilities to pay. Now we have a dozen streaming services, $300 phone bills another $100 for internet. Our $10 coffees and vapes. Bs expenses went up sky high.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@gregorywemyss,"Listen the video really helped me break the illusion that someone is going to help me, however when you mentioned going to the gym when tired I just really didn't understand the emotional logic or the logical logic, I mean maybe if your body is tired its trying to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity, myself I am already burnt out, and you tell me go to the gym, that's not gonna restore me that's gonna waste more of my time that could be devoted to something more productive, such as figuring out a way to escape the cycle of 40 Hour work weeks, I mean instead of going to the gym ive figure out how to save a couple bucks so I dont have to work the extra 10, bring on the four day work weeks please.

Also your point about streamers not succeeding compared to being a doctor kinda destroys the point, I mean a steamer is a career doing one of the most relaxing things possible but in a very structured and organised manner that is designed to be entertaining, comparing it to being a doctor is ridiculous people become doctors due to overt pressures placed on them by family and society and can be a very taxing job, with a high entry level, think of all the people working run down jobs who's parents wished them to become doctors, 14 years of training in the uk to become fully qualified, vs 5 years of work and streaming to maybe become successful. Two different goals and entirely different kinds of people, not only that to get into university, to get money to study is much higher than trying to be a streamer and buying a webcam and a pc, also your saying your trying to help people, but people dont watch twitch for help, they watch it like generic tv these days, but we always need doctors and we always need entertainment, hopefully one day its just entertainment needed more than doctors, so your twitch career wasn't going to take off anytime soon, I do not have enough experience but as a viewer im telling you id rather watch some random play a game I like than get advice on all my problems, your bringing problems to escapism haha.

My last point I wanted to touch on is thank you for this video it provides that forward looking logic that is missing from 40 hour work weeks, but I think that for these kinds of issues maybe some financial advice or a careers advisor may come in better place, or just as an addition to your video.

Most laws voted on go against the interests of lower-middle-class workers. 
Until we reduce inequality in our countries, we cannot hope for a better life.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@JKBeck-dw7dd,"I worked an average of 60-80 hours per week (usually two jobs or one job while picking up as much overtime as possible) for the entirety of my 20s, telling myself if I 'just work harder' I would reach a point where it got easier or I got to a job I found enjoyable. 10 years of nonstop-two-fulltime-job grind and it never got easier. Instead, I burnt out to a point where I struggle to even feed myself most days because the effort of eating (even if it's pre-made food) is too much. I sometimes wonder if I'd instead conserved my energy, I wouldn't be at this point. And I sometimes wonder if I'd worked 3 jobs or 90-100 hours a week (which tbf, I even did that for a short while and ended up hospitalized form it) I'd have reached that point were it would be easier. Both situations feel like a losing option. 

I'm not really sure there is an escape from this, when everything is optimized to keep people working at exactly the level where they don't die, but not an ounce less. It's not even necessarily the amount of work that is making it unbearable, but the lack of time to actually live. No time to socialize and break out of isolation. No energy to even keep up with texts (I barely look at my phone these days) to maintain the semblance of social interaction. No time for hobbies or passions. It makes it hard to feel there's much worth living for when you're not even allowed to live, just allowed to survive a life you don't even enjoy. Not sure how to work harder than your hardest without completely reaching the point where a complete exit from living becomes the only real option to consider.

I don't need to own a house. I don't need to travel the world. I don't need fancy marble countertops or the newest smartphone. I just need time and energy to actually live. To have friends.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@JordanFayter,"I remember when I was younger, after high school, I was working 7 days a week, 2-3 jobs a day, before I went to college to become a Healthcare Assistant. Even when I was in school, I found ways to make extra income either through my actual jobs on the side, finding things I could do to bring in extra income for investments or finding ways to earn cryptocurrency, finding different things I could sell. I even worked as a Panago Pizza dishwasher for $6 an hour, which was still under minimum wage at the time, but I got a free large pizza after every shift. I would save up all my pizzas and on Friday night, when the Boys and Girls Club had a night for the teens called Nights Alive. I would get all my pizzas made and go to the grocery store across the street and get 2L bottles of pop. I would sell pizza and pop, along with cigarettes and whatever else I saw that there was a market for. Even in Elementary School, I was playing for keeps with other kids and selling or trading my winnings, selling candy and pop, and just studying people, how to read people. With all my learning disabilities, the schools and teachers didn't want to teach me. I was given a teacher's Assistant to do all my work (reading, writing, tests, and so on). I didn't even get homework like the rest of my class. I spent my day in school learning more about people and how to manipulate them if I wanted to, and when I went home, I would teach myself. I remember learning about quantum mechanics and quantum physics in my own time as an elementary school student while the rest of my class was doing their homework or enjoying their weekend.",0,2025-06-28T17:34:52Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@patrickrudiger8762,"Working harder than 40h/week is not going to cut it. Its totally naive and an idiotic position to have that working harder is a solution. Fact is: It is not ok to expect ppl to work more. Absolutely not. That ppl are poor is the result of immoral behaviour that needs to be addressed.

In the last 70years, producitity raised a LOT. And that continued in the last 20 years. So how comes, that now 40 hours is no longer enough to build something up but barely enough to survive for many people? Very simple. The share of the GDP going to capital gains and thus the already wealthy climbed and climbed and climbed. Todays billionaires are like the rubber barons. They are just more efficient, more evil, more dangerous.

And their behaviour, at least in the US, is literally killing people. Via lack of propper food, deprivation from healthcare etc.

Oh and by the way, you know what happens when all try to make ends meet by working more? Its quite simply. Without goverment regulation, for labour the same applies as for any good and service: Supply and demand regulate the price. So if all work longer, the price for work per hour will fall. In fact, it will plummet hard, because even for a lower price, there is not enough demand four labour. Thus, those owning the means of production can reduce the wages even further and increase their profit margin even more.

If you want to know how, in history, conditions like they are today got resolved, maybe google ""haymarket affair"" or ""the new deal"" or any other society upheaval that lead to the transformation of a society with a rich decadent upper class into a society that shows more equality . Workers need to stand up for their rights. They need to get the correct politicians in place. They need to make sure, that the rich folks pay their fair share.",3,2025-06-27T20:57:24Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@magic369z,"I have been going through this for years and one thing I have learned is that when you are always tired, numb, depressed is because you are not living the way that you're supposed to. If your job makes you miserable it's because you are not suppose to do that. Your body will tell you what you need to do and if you don't follow your intuition you will suffer the consequences.

Of course it makes sense logically to work a job you don't like to afford to live but guess what trading security for freedom isn't the solution. We have been brainwashed to think that jobs will give us security but safety is only a prison. What's funny is that having a job is no longer safe you can literally can get fired any day without warning and not only that most job will disappear because of AI. 

9-5 is a scam, maybe it worked for other generations but we are the ones who are currently suffering the consequences. But we also have way more opportunities than other generations to make an income because of the internet. I don't want to be the don't settle for a 9-5 and start your own business guy but we have to accept the reality of our current world. I think a more balanced approach will be to get a part-time job and have a side hustle or just have multiple sources of income in general. It's either that or pray to get lucky and find someone who will hire you at a job that you probably want to quit couple of months from now. 

Also prioritizing your mental health is key, I see a lot of people ruining their mental health working at jobs they hate. A choice I had to make was I rather be at peace and broke than miserable and financially secure. When you are at peace you think more clearly and have more energy to put towards achieving goals that are worth it to you not tasks that other people gave to you. 


If a job is the thing you spend the most time doing that means that you means that it's literally the most important decision you will make in your life. Don't act like your work is something separate from your life because it's not. If you hate your job and you're stuck financially you might have to hit the reset button. Quit your job, sell your car and go live with your parents, go back to school if that's what you need to do.

If you want more than those options, you're expected to go online, and that's shown that it's not a true substitute for in-person socialization. And that's not even getting into how this gets limited even more if you're still a student (the way modern teenagers are basically seen as criminals to be shunned & barred from all non-school establishments is especially damaging).

Also, saying this as someone who is a single only child with aging parents, my weekends aren't even ""working for myself"" so much as ""working for them"" and doing things for them such as heavy yard work or just entertaining them (one parent is still working & has said that my visits are ""the highlight of their week"").

In reality it was more than 50: get on work at 8 o'clock, get out at 19, sometimes a bit later, sometimes a bit earlier. Due to Paris Olympics it took from 2h30 to 4h total to get to work and back each day! So basically I did not have even time to cook at a dormitory (there it was just a room with a bed and a wc, a 1h-1h30 ride from Paris, but it still costed more than my whole ""salary"" per month). Coming back there I had no even strength to do anything, because Parisian RER system is sucking the rest of the forces out - you get at home at around 22h, a shower if there is hot water and then sleep, get up at 6h  and repeat. We did not even have food at the lab (It was reserved to those in the French system): only tonns of coffee to keep your head buzzing, so I was eating something I could buy in the nearest store to the lab,  usually cold: cold soup and bread, sometimes get-out lunchboxes, but not a lot due to prices. No normal sleep, a supervisor who shouts at you and treats you like a bug and an idiot (but still a very distinguished and capable scientist though), no food, and not even a descent chair to sit (at Sorbonne they are in deficit, so I still have pain in the back after one year). We were working some days in a clean room and imagine that you are going out from there like twice during 8 hours a day - no water or toilet, just processing, processing, processing...
 It was very interesting (without sarcasm), the topic was great, but even if you love the topic - after 6 months of such a grind you want to fucking jump under RER (which I think many people here do, because it has always perturbed traffic due to a ""person accident"" , several times a week), and there were some PhD students there who were doing 3 years like this (but much higher paid and mostly with a Crous governmental accommodation, which is the same price, but much closer to the lab)... - imagine that and these people are the most educated ones, what is going on with the lower classes is even worse.
PS also, I mentioned that the work was really interesting - it is true. we even had worked on a cyclotron, but there the shift was around 30 hours ( yes, without sleep) - very interesting 30 hours, but you are trading your heath for this interest.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@Nozdromu13,"Well, what we used to have was:

One person per household, could make enough money to maintain normal survival for their significant other and the offspring. It took, a normal job, that needed basically commitment and will to do it. If you decided to create your own business, chances were that you will have an above average experience. Good university degree and all of the above, almost guaranteed a pretty high level of life. And if you did all that, and got lucky/took risks that didn't backfire, you might even join the ultra wealthy around 40-50. 

So basically, you could to a degree, choose the amounts of fucks given daily and receive an equal amount of wealth back. 

This is an insanely simplified example of cours, metric fucktons of luck or lack of it, influenced every single step of such journeys, and of course many failed or had misfortunes. But the reality was, a mailman who was honest and regular at his job, could bring home a salary to support having said home and family. No luxuries, just simple life with normal amount of stuff in it. 

Right now:

Hahahahahahaha, nope. Mailman with a family on single salary is just not possible. You will not manage. The salary of one grown-up person, in entry to mid level jobs, is giving you barely survival. You do not OWN the house as the previous same mailman could. You probably do not even have a partner not to mention family with children. And you give the same amount of fucks, but receive way less wealth for it.

Things with rent  are similar here in Germany. I was able to study computer science  basically for free, which earned me a well paying job at a big German hosting company. 
Rent is still crushing, since I also unexpectedly became a father, which didn't make things cheaper and definitely takes the biggest chunk of my spare time, but we can afford everything we need to. 
But I still see no real trajectory, owning a house  with a garden for my daughter to play in will probably stay a dream. I still feel like a wage slave. I can save money, but it will never be enough to go places in life. Most of my savings go into an ETF, to save my pension; since our system is deemed to collapse before I can retire. (I don't think the generations before us even had to think 40 years ahead like we do) I simply can't justify spending more than half a million euros on a decent house, especially with Russia invading Europe. If they deem Ukraine a success and are able to rebuild their military, attacking NATO is probably the next step in the next 10 years. That's another big stress factor.

I'm also quite sure that I'm depressed. I don't get excited anymore, every day feels like a waste, like a day not truly lived. It feels like I'm living my live to generate income for someone else, and then the realization kicks in, that I'm in this loop for the next 40 years. Its crushing.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@ThiagoVenturadeSousa,"I might disagree here. 
As a Brazilian Psychologist, i think the issue is more about how capitalism, and not as an ideology, but how a failured economy model in third world countries, is driving the entire world ( and now including USA) into a hellhole to keep the billionaires wealthy, rather than solving mental issues. 

This is the same issue with the ""Generation (Dragon ball) Z"" pseudoscientific stuff. That we blame on the young and well educated people that is not getting 225hour/month jobs for a wage of  250USD/month and without any working class benefits. 4

You have no vacation, you must keep your presence in work every day and if you skip a day, you'll lose a day of work and therefore the money worth of working during that day, and if by any means the contractor ends your contract, you get out without any assitance. 

So, you must work until your very own life runs dry or else you can't even survive in this world. 

this sounds a little bit like the Yungian definition of hell. which is like... the entire world outside western Europe, Aussie and New Zealand ( A.K.A Middle earth on earth) and the US ( Canada is a British Colony, tho). 

So, yup... we need to discuss this looking more into a ""Intern Brute Product growth vs mental health"" rather than just a "" just mental health"" kind of issue.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@oneness-12,"This might be the first time I find myself at odds with your perspective. The core issue, as I see it, is the attempt to conjure solutions from the very environment that spawned the problem in the first place.

Consider someone utterly exhausted, clearly too isolated to share their burdens. Offering them a ""solution"" like ""if you push yourself harder, you'll eventually feel less tired"" might be the most ""realistic"" approach in that moment, but it's unequivocally not the most humane.

You touched on the voting dilemma, and it's a perfect parallel. In this country, people are given only two options, forced to pick the lesser of two evils, leading many to simply abstain from voting altogether. Or, someone who initially couldn't fathom voting for a particular candidate ends up doing so in the next election.

Trying to find answers within the system that's the root cause of the problem will, at best, only redirect the issue. It might, in the most optimistic scenario, merely postpone it.

The truth is, the life we're living‚Äîor rather, the life we no longer have time to truly live‚Äîand the neoliberal framework we're caught in, fundamentally oppose many of humanity's factory settings. It's pushing individuals daily toward an inevitable, grim conclusion.

Those who've ventured outside the US to countries with more ""normal"" conditions‚Äîwhere people aren't mechanized, and social bonds remain strong‚Äîcan clearly see that the solution isn't found where the problem originated.

I couldn't stand the unachievable metrics and went back to school for x-ray. There are less metrics in X-ray... But managers and hospital administrators have still figured out because everything is so tracked... How many patients you should see in an hour. And they're not paying you to sit still so if they can they try to fill up as much as possible to keep you busy. For the past few weeks I've asked my family and a close friend Why is it that over 100 years ago the 40-hour work week was created but here we are still working 40 hours a week. Where is this technology.. I don't care if we get to Mars or if I have to drive my own car... Why haven't we whittled down work to a 6-hour work day... We are working harder than we have before...

Then, at some point, the Boomers at the top became blinded by their success and their empathy and compassion for those less fortunate eroded. Survivor bias. Profit at the expense of sustainability became the norm. And they projected their own entitlement on Gen X, Y and Z in order to avoid any nagging sense of guilt for their insatiable greed.

I didn‚Äôt need TikTok to tell me I was being exploited in 2020 during the pandemic. I lived the exploitation first hand. I got to experience other people forcing me to risk my life just to keep the economy going so stock prices wouldn‚Äôt dip.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@samaelfederchen9926,"I have to disagree where the tirednesscomes from. 40h of work are NOT the same at every place! Having a toxic workplace with unreachable expectations, no job training and too high density and responsibility leads to chronic stress. You can NOT train and adapt to that!

For more than a year I tried to convince myself once I am better in this task it will get easier. It didnt, the tasks just got even more. I ended with stress related hair loss and chronic headache aswell as untreated inflammations.

The 40h job I work now is half the workload and pays more. Sorry but saying ""all ofyou are just tired because you are addicted to your phones"" is a dangerous oversimplification!

Also, being always just one misstep away from homelessness prevents you from setting healthy boundaries at work - towards your colleagues towards your clients and customers and towards your boss. You stop saying no. So the risk rises to be mistreated and molested and to get even more workload. Which makes you angry and exhausted even more.

I get that it's a tough ask to expect enough individual people to take issue with their workplace, where they currently live, or do much to change how much gas costs but is it too much to ask that you stop shopping at Amazon? Stop using Facebook/Instagram? Stop buying a new $1,000 phone every other year? We entitle the biggest individual contributors to the problem to continue being the biggest individual contributors of the problem. That may be a tough ask too given how dug into our lives some of these big companies are but it's certainly not too tough to ask that we use our voting powers responsibly. 

We keep bickering over Left vs Right and getting stuck on issues that don't really matter like abortion, DEI, and transgender rights. Leave those alone and let people make whatever choices they want to make. I don't see a logical reason why we need to get involved in personal choices like that. Feel how you feel but the more important issues like the economic situation we find ourselves in keeps getting ignored. People will vote for a guy who says what they want to hear about a social issue and completely ignore that this person will raise their taxes, give tax breaks to the already ultra wealthy, and straight up not answer questions people ask them about issues. What's worse is that when neither of the two candidates from the two parties we've inexplicably boiled our choices down to fit the bill, we won't even consider a third option. If a Republican doesn't vote Republican the Democrat will win and visa versa and because our team has to win, we only vote one way forever. It's like being stuck in traffic right next to an exit that will take you home and choosing not to take it. It makes no sense and will never change and that's what's so frustrating to me.

I worked myself to exhaustion to pay off my debts, buy a house, learn how to fix my own stuff, and stay debt-free. I went back to school to try and increase my job prospects and income. I got a degree online and paid the tuition each semester with careful financial planning. I thought I was doing great. Then I had a kid and the medical bills even with ""good insurance"" put me into debt. I had a major car repair and even just buying the parts and doing the work myself put me into more debt. I got a ""promotion"" at work which meant a 5% pay raise... and 25% more work to do. Bad deal. Plus with sleep deprivation helping my wife take care of a baby. Running on pure adrenaline and lots of caffeine just to stay awake. And I'm going ""good"" compared to many, which feels terrible to say. It feels like my hard work wasn't worth it and I still don't deserve what I have because so many work just as hard and are struggling so much more.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@KayByte,"Aw man i feel her so badly. I actually earn more vs rent and savings. So we've saved up and can finally buy a house as two people. But its basically now house poor to own a decent house with a 40 min drive to work. 0 money to do it up, 0 savings left, and we worked out it would take us 2 years to save a 6 months emergency fund for just the bare minimum. And thats if we spent nothing on anything, just the mortgage, food and bills for those 2 years. And we've not gone extreme on the house or anything. Its just a small bungalow with a tiny garden in Scotland. So yeah... Not ideal.


But it's the mental exhaustion after work. I notice woman struggling with this more tbh anecdotally, unless they get into a position where they are making decisions and changing things early on, or when there's some form of reward in the work you do.

I've had one role where i was really happy then they moved me and now i despise my current role because its so meaningless and task heavy. 40 hour weeks in general just burn you out, we weren't meant to do this. But less so sitting still in front of an office. But if I try to go for a creative role, i can't earn enough. If i want to pick up some qualifications for the type of roles i do want... Well AI is going to wipe those roles out in the next 2-5 years. And to boot, I'm too exhausted to study new things in my mid 30s, doing 40 hours in front of a desk not moving with adhd. I don't know how many times I've broken down crying at it like her. God the extra money stress she's dealing makes it so much harder :(

My brain is so depleted after the day, all my hobbies stop being fun and i cant do them or anything because im so exhausted and they all feel like work. So i just go to bed and that's it until the next day when i get up for work. i just have no energy mentally left at all.

This system is horrific and squeezes people dry. We weren't meant to live like this but the system makes it so we can't afford to live any other way, and have 0 energy to invest into breaking out of it.

The idea of going off grid in Scotland? Unaffordable unfortunately also. 

Life is just impossible tbh and idk how many times ive just dipped to the idea of suicide despite being a generally happy stable person, that doesn't struggle with mental health. Only burn out from the way existence and jobs are. Give me a month off and I'll be the most productive happy, stable person you ever meet. Put me in a meaningless desk job for 40 hours and no chance.

There is no reason that in the US in 2025, people need to be just barely surviving despite working so hard and that's if you can get a job. Capitalism requires a ""reserve army of labor."" During the Depression, the government put people to work because capitalists are only incidentally job creators, they won't do it if it's beneficial to sit on their money and do nothing. We still have these wonderful parks built from that time. Some of us are literally not useful to the system, so they want us in prison or unemployed. While some of us can ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps"" (literally a thing that is not possible, it was created as a critique of this way of thinking), most of us can't, no matter how hard we try. In Scandinavia, there is significantly more opportunity for upward mobility. They have the American dream, we don't. There are not enough good paying jobs, not enough jobs, not enough affordable places to live where there are also jobs. There isn't enough to go around and that's why we are so miserable. This is a feature, not a bug. The fact that increased productivity led to increased wages after the post-WWII boom. where the US benefited the most from a US-run world order, still haunts us. There's this assumption that student debt is legitimate when my mom went to a private university and only had to work part time to pay her tuition in the mid-70s, whereas I basically could only make enough to eat and buy books and had to work for the city government for ten years to get my $30k of debt forgiven and I went to a public university. The billionaires are hoarding it all. Nothing is meant to trickle down, so none of it does. If this budget reconciliation goes through, it will lead to more struggling and poverty and excess deaths. Us on YouTube are probably not at that end of this, but we could be at any day because there is no social responsibility taken for the fact that bad things happen, you get sick, you get laid off, whatever, and you deserve to have a way to not just die when that happens. The fact that this is happening when a loud contingent of the people pushing the cruelest policies are supposedly Christian, is just the icing on top. Jesus is too woke.

Why do the rich get to pay fines for stealing MILLIONS while a bank robber goes to prison for life?

5AB2l8Cehwk,@Nermalton77,"I love the analogy of ""the meta has been optimized"". In economical terms what happens is that we live in a world where the struggle of capital vs labour has tilted a lot to favor capital, compared to how it used to be in the 50s. This way, the wealthiest shares of our society own much more of the resources, and get a much higher share of the newly generated wealth that is produced. This way, they are able to charge you much more rent for us of their real estate, while paying less for your work. 
The wealthy people in the world have managed that by ""figuring the meta"", that is, automating production to get rid of need for labour, finding ways to pay less taxes, increasing their influence on politics, pushing for de-regulation, removing barries for worldwide movement of capital, etc. 
I agree with Dr. K focus on trying to understand what you can do to improve your situation. But on a societal level we need to discuss how to keep this people from figuring out the meta, for example by normalizing the idea of wealth taxes",30,2025-06-23T10:57:39Z

And the strangest part is that you're right Dr. K. We cannot blame the very system that caused the problem, as unfair and sad that it makes us. We cannot allow our internal circuitry to be affected by the external circumstances that are outside of our control.

Being ""pissed off"" or ""anxious"", or having ""fear"" about these external circumstances drains us from our internal storehouse of energy and motivation. Technology dependence, sensory over-stimulation, and stress-eating are just some examples of emotional exhaustion. These hijack our short-term, near future, emotional circuitry parts of the brain with the promise of relief from the uncontrollable external circumstances, but ends up further depleting us from the very storehouses of motivation and energy that we need to break ourselves out of this rut.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@BiggieChungulus,"Gonna soft disagree with Dr K here. I work 60+ hours a week in a high volume catering kitchen. He's right, once you essentially level up, the grueling hours get more tolerable. Having a baseline of fitness helps too, just more shit to do with your already limited free time. For me it's bouldering. However even at this level, it still is utterly exhausting. Because I have a pretty good balance of sleep diet and exercise I still wake up every day more or less replenished, but some days it's genuinely an uphill battle just getting out of bed. Ya know that Berserk meme with guts screaming? That's what it feels like battling my fried CNS for control over what I do sometimes. That's what it feels like to get out of bed some days. I say all this because I'm deeply empathetic to those like the person in the beginning of this video. I consider myself relatively reselient, hard working, and athletic and it's THIS hard for me. How the fuck are normal people even still surviving? 

So basically Dr K says to progressive overload. 15 minutes of work here. 15 more minutes there. Over time. Slowly working your way up. Basically this does work kind of, but just because you become more able to tolerate extremes doesn't mean you don't feel the extremeness of whatever you're tolerating.",0,2025-06-21T19:29:54Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@mimiminti,"I appreciate Dr. K approaching this topic, however I feel like this discussion is incomplete. I think the problem is not optimization as much as the price of rent is far above a fair representation of value transferred. My small landlord draws about 20K/month from all his properties but he does literally ZERO repairs and I live in a slum. I see it with big landlords too. The average rent being 1600 is the problem. They have leveraged the fact that housing is an imperfect market where tenants have no way to ensure reasonable prices for rent. I think there is no individual way out of it and that we need to talk to our neighbors to form use tenant organizations to ensure repairs, and eventually form city level tenant unions that can fight for tenant rights on a state level. Right now landlords lobby to pass the legislation, and real estate entangled governers like Jared Polis will veto solutions, such as the bipartisan bill on curbing the insanely unethical rent pricing algorithm. 

My energy comes from having a home where I can form healthy living habits, but that has gotten harder as I've had to take on roommates. There is another thing to be said about the stagnation of wages, but I think the landlords are the biggest problem in the room.",0,2025-06-21T17:42:17Z

Is there any jobs that are minimum wage or $15 or higher for a full time work week?
Is there any other options of living that are below $1200 that you can afford that keeps your non-negotiables (ex: I will not go without wi-fi, heating, etc.) 
Do you have any support network in terms of family, friends, peers, someone or some group or organization to go to?
If all else is not possible at the moment, yeah what Dr.K says: is there any way of making work not as bad or even enjoyable? How do you spend that time outside of work, is there a lot on the phone, bad sleep, no time outside? How‚Äôs your diet? 

This puts a lot of responsibility on her, but if no one is coming to help you, what can you do in your situation aside from just endure? For how long will you endure?

I know it's harder for americans to understand, since you have an extreme form of capitalism and have been even more brainwashed by it than most other first world countries, but the solution to this is to take wealth back from the rich, probably through taxes. This is what made the baby boomer generation have oportunitines. 

Humanity is wealthier as a whole now that it has ever been and life still sucks for most people, and the reason for this is inequality. There is a _lot_ of wealth, and the rich have most of it.

The only solution for that is organization. Sure, you can probably do some stuff like Dr K said to make your life suck less, but this will only get you so far. Voting for billionaries and expecting them to have your interest at heart is ludicrous.

Organizing to take wealth back from the rich is hard, but it's doable, it has been done before, when people got fed up.

I've learned a lot from you so far, and I'm really grateful for that. Now that we're getting into economics and the reasons why it's becoming harder for people to make a living, I hope I can show you something in return.

The reason why we‚Äôre being paid less and less over time isn‚Äôt because of efficiency or because we‚Äôve ‚Äúfigured things out.‚Äù It‚Äôs due to the inflationary monetary system.

Technological progress and increased efficiency should actually mean that everything becomes cheaper over time, because we can produce things more effectively. But here‚Äôs the problem: let‚Äôs say people have become, on average, 30% more efficient at producing goods. That would typically lead to deflation ‚Äî a 30% decrease in prices.

However, since central banks have a mandate to aim for 2% inflation (i.e., price increases), they will actively work against that deflation. This means any natural deflation is systematically eliminated, and on top of that, an additional 2% inflation is deliberately targeted.

Unfortunately, the incentives are also set up so that central banks always manage to ""achieve"" those 2% inflation figures. And since they calculate inflation themselves, they also have an incentive to make the numbers look better than they are ‚Äî for example, by adjusting the basket of goods (used to measure inflation) to include cheaper or lower-quality items that have lower price increases, while removing higher-quality goods that have risen more in price.

On top of that, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) only includes consumer goods ‚Äî it excludes assets like real estate.

Since rising credit levels don‚Äôt necessarily lead to a proportional increase in demand for consumer goods (but rather for assets like real estate), asset prices tend to rise far more than the CPI does.

Because wages are usually only adjusted according to the CPI ‚Äî which, as mentioned, is both manipulated and incomplete ‚Äî real wages fall over time in terms of what people can actually afford. That‚Äôs why it keeps getting harder to make ends meet, even though, on paper, it looks like wages are keeping up with inflation.

So the real issue isn‚Äôt efficiency ‚Äî it‚Äôs the inflationary monetary system.

Much love, and please keep up the amazing work you're doing!",1,2025-06-21T09:07:15Z

What I initially wanted for me was killing me, picking up other things made everything a lot better. Also down the line I understood that instead of being FAANG employee in the future, I just want to open a small bar or just work normal job and have a family, fu*k this sh*t, I was so stupid thinking that slaving away and selling my passion towards technology and solving problems would make me happy, it only could work it I was 5% of the talent in the field, but I am not. I am good enough to solve problems and get stuff done but that's about it. 

The point is, if work and career is not working anymore to carry you, you need something else that fills the hole in your heart. For me it was being a god damn weeb.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@selbie,"Millennial here. Something I've noticed over the years with enjoyment of work, and maybe it could be expanded on a bit:
The term ""Enjoy"" doesn't mean ""I'm having fun and everything is smiles and happiness"" - unless you are in a rare, super lucky situation. Try to frame it as ""I feel my work is important, I know what I need to be competent and accomplish the work, and I have the autonomy to complete it"". If you are passionate about something and are rewarded in the ways that matter to you, the time you spend working on it becomes insignificant, and the tiredness you feel each day / week is more like a levelling-up experience.
That can fluctuate depending on the context and role you are in, but when it starts to trend toward ""not important"", ""not clear"" and / or ""not autonomous"", then you are probably not enjoying the work. Dr. K has great videos on burn-out relating to this.
Then there is the tiredness factor of this video:
Older generations benefitted from the relative calm of life without the internet and everything was accessed through physical participation - which set up resilient habits to live well on (in general). This is what Dr K is referring to about exercise and tiredness. An athlete's tiredness is no different to an amateurs tiredness, except for the amount of practice they've had at getting tired and noticing improvements over time. 
The problem we face now is that we are oversaturated with digital access to infinite information, so the older generations have the advantage of those established habits but the younger gens are less likely to have those natural skills and some don't know HOW to step away from it - something that used to be normal AND WAS EASY TO ACCESS before the internet became ubiquitous in the late 90s / early 2000s. We might have a few select advantages, but there are so many external debuffs stacked on us that simply pushing a high amount of effort is quickly negated by the elite endgame players. 
So society now has no choice but to apply substantial effort to avoid the saturated noise so that we can fit enjoyment of things back in to our pre-internet biology. We actually have to perform work on enjoyment of work, so that the work we perform is actually enjoyable :P",0,2025-06-21T07:07:07Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@vincentlius1569,"As a 23-year-old Gen Z professional with two years of work experience, I've developed a clear ""what I can do about it"" philosophy for navigating my career and personal growth.

Embrace Calculated Risks
Playing it safe won't get me where I want to be. I'm choosing to embrace more risk, particularly in my investments and career path. For instance, I'm shifting away from overpriced blue-chip stocks and opting for more dynamic investments. While most of my current portfolio is in gold ‚Äì a hedge against potential global instability ‚Äì I'm also willing to job-hop more frequently. This includes taking on roles with the inherent risk of not passing probation or being among the first for layoffs.

Master the AI Revolution
I believe we're at a pivotal point, similar to how ancient Rome transitioned to a slave-based economy, ultimately leading to chaos due to unemployment. Our world faces a similar threat with the rise of AI. To thrive, we must learn to leverage AI to automate work through products and services. My focus is on deeply understanding how to build, design, market, and utilize AI.

Cultivate Hope and Connection
As highlighted in various discussions, maintaining a sense of ""future prospect"" is crucial for sustained energy and motivation. My personal goal is to gain experience in a developed country for 3-5 years before returning to Southeast Asia. This offers significant leverage due to currency differences. It's about finding your own version of ""hope"" that fuels your drive.

Prioritize ""Fast Recharge"" Hobbies and Meaningful Friendships
I used to maintain an intense 12-14 hour workday, including weekends, balancing a startup job and college. While I gradually built up to this workload, I found myself completely exhausted and lost after about 1.5 years. Now that I've graduated, I prioritize ""fast recharge hobbies."" Instead of mindlessly scrolling social media, I'm selective about consuming highly recommended anime or manga. I've also gravitated towards upbeat music and, most importantly, I dedicate time to friends with whom I have genuine connections. I'm not afraid to cut off relationships that don't serve me or limit interactions to once a quarter if that's what's best for my well-being.",0,2025-06-21T06:40:59Z

It used to be here that at her age two bedrooms meant two salaries splitting the bill either through being roommates or spouses. Or alternatively there was a man who either had done the early grinding in salary ladder or did overtime and paid it all so that he would have a wife at home that handled the household chores.   Another thing that has changed is that we have more things that we no longer consider optional.  Let me state my expenses around age of 20.  Relatively cheap internet, single bedroom with shared kitchen and bathroom, macaroni with few cheap additions to it, city bus pass, electricity and water was included, but those are not much either today. It's was temporarily going backwards in lifestyle from living in parents place. And that's the sad truth. Sometimes you need to make temporarily sacrifices to have either time or money to invest in the future. 

Modern job matching is like modern dating apps. Women have to weed out too many bad candidates and get occassionally duped to pick a terrible one because most good ones already have got selected out of market.  Men have too low rate of getting selected and get disillusioned by their prospects.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@REGRIGBY5678,"I like how you talk about it being expectations based. An anecdote from my own life. I went though all of elementary, middle and high school never procrastinating and studying a lot and making sure I got all straight As cuz I was told BY THE SHCOOLS that I needed to do that to get into a good college so I could get a good job and live a good life. My parents never really hounded on me cuz I did get straight As all the time. So then I get into the good college, and again, I never procrastinating and studied a lot and made sure I got straight As (most of the time) so I could then get a good job. I also played a sport in college like I did in school growing up and I wanted to play more. So I took a masters program at the same college. Same thing again, don't procrastinate use all the campus resources, study hard. I graduated at the top of the class for my cohort. So then I'm like, ""okay sick now I get to get a job and be set the rest of my life"". A couple months go by, no real progress with interviews. ""Oh that's okay its the summer and I'm enjoying having finished all my schooling thats fine"". I move back in with my parents, 2 more months go by, no job. They're like, ""hey man you need to have a job"" and I'm like ""I thought I was supposed to have one by now. I did all the steps, I sacrificed having a ton of fun because I was forwarding thinking. Trying to better my future self."" A couple more months go by and I find some part time work to appease my parents. I still haven't found a job related to my masters degree after over a year. Finally after a couple more months I get an offer to work full time, its not very much pay, but at least its something. And I end up having to move across the entire country to do it. I think for a lot of people who are around my age (im 24 rn) its just sucks to feel like you followed the path you were told to follow and check all the boxes, but life just doesn't actually work that way. It kinda feels like we got lied to. And then we're expected to just hate ourselves and suffer so people who are super rich can get even richer. 

A second anecdote related tertiary to what the girl int eh video was saying. I truly and honestly have no clue how people in the generations before us had 9-5 jobs and were able to live healthy lives. I guess maybe they didn't/don't if you look at the illnesses so many people have. But like I mentioned I played a sport in college and I still play it now. And look, I wasn't good enough to go pro, but I was around people who did and we were all on the same team and so we'd do the same habits. Tracking all your calories, making sure you're eating the right macros, optimizing your sleep, working out at the gym, training sessions, mental performance work, just general therapy and relaxation time to make sure you perform at your best. Working 8 hours a day makes it EXTREMELY difficult to take care of your health. You're stuck at work for those 8 hours unable to leave, so you need to do your gym time before or after, but you also need to make sure to meal prep your lunch so you can eat something nutritious at work lunch. So you need to sort out when you can go to the gym and when you can prep your meals. That already cuts some hours out of your day. Then you have to commute to and from work and to and from the gym. You can choose to do that before work or after work. Either of those choices will impact when you go to sleep. But you need to make sure you can get at least 8 hours of sleep to perform well. When its all said in done you basically have 2 hours left in each workday to use on leisure activities. At least in my experience. And maybe this is the privilege talking, but how is that enough time. And this is if you have the drive to ACTUALLY be able to do the relaxing stuff. Like the girl said its exhausting working. I'd never experienced stress in school because I would work ahead to finish all my assignments and prepare for my tests. You have a rewarding period at the end that you work towards. That's what we were taught in school. But that's not what a 9-5 is like. IT. NEVER. ENDS. There is no test, there's nothing to study for, there's no end. Why the heck are we taught this workflow pattern for our entire lives if that's not what the real world is like? No wonder people don't eat healthy, no wonder they don't work out, no wonder they get poor sleep. Doing all those things to stay healthy takes some work and discipline, but now you're getting yelled at by your boss at work, in a constant state of stress with no end in sight. People don't have the bandwidth for all of that. The other generations having the audacity to call us lazy is myopic to me. At least we had the drive to create some positive change for people to live healthier lives. Just because things have been done a certain way for a long time doesn't make them right. And at least to me, in the present day those methods DON'T work anymore. 

Idk, would love to here any other Gen Z people my age give their thoughts on this. Is this how you're feeling too? I know I'm currently trying to leave my current job and find something where you can actually live a healthy life. Maybe that's why so many people just become influencers. Its a way to have a balanced day, even if its mostly pedaling scam products to impressionable people or rage baiting. At least you have the opportunity to have some work life balance. Maybe I'm just salty that I wasn't good enough to go pro, or I wasn't networked enough to get a really good job with my masters, but it does kinda feel like I worked really hard for no reason. Well, anyhoo, these videos always help me out a lot when I'm struggling with stuff so keep up with the good content, and I hope some other people get something from my text walls up there haha.

I work 38 hours a week, at the end of every week i have about 700 dollars paid after tax and with an accommodation suppliment benefit from the govt. 
I live with a partner who is studying, split rent,  scrape by on bills and neccessities and can still save a hundered bucks a week. At least. And i dont feel like im going anywhere fast but comparitively i feel very privaleged.

If youre living with flatmates or partners and having to pay $1600 out of the $2000 you earn a month, that's just messed up. The system failed you. If youre living alone, in a 2 bedroom apartment then maybe that is a problem that needs to chage. But I doubt its your fault to begin with. 2000usd still expensive as hell and calculating the exchange rate to nz that would be $840 dollar out of my bank a week which is just impossible. or $420 with a flatmate, still terrible considering food and bills will be spent with the rest of my wages without anything to fall back on.",0,2025-06-21T02:54:33Z

Hell, I'm approaching 40, a lot of kids younger than me have it way harder than me even interacting face to face and getting out of the house. Then there's other things like this garbage housing crisis that they have us blaming on these big funds that buy up houses but really it's mostly (in my opinion) a bunch of NIMBYism across the country where everyone complains about housing prices but no area wants to step up and BUILD houses. I live in a super liberal area, and I'm liberal myself. They wanted to build new apartments here and everyone FLIPPED OUT. It would increased traffic, it would do XYZ. It's like at some point if all these governments and populations and zoning boards don't allow housing to be built, we're gonna be in a situation like we are now where it's super hard to buy a home. 

We are also weaker in many ways fundamentally. My parents both commuted 90 minutes plus back and forth into the city, they'd leave the house around 6:30ish and come home around 7 PM. They didn't grow up with money and they gladly did it for good money. For us now we think going back to the office isn't even a fair thing. I'm not saying it is or it isn't, but things bother us way more now than they ever did before. 

I bet for 90% of us, and I'm not excluding myself, if they audited their average week they have spent at least 30+ hours scrolling on social media, playing video games, watching tv, browsing reddit, etc. We need to figure out how to take our minds and our focus back and it's REALLY difficult.

There is of course also a psychological component to many kinds of chronic fatigue syndrome, but there have been cases where people have literally died because they have been prescribed graded exercise therapy, because their chronic fatigue was not solely psychological or mental, but rather followed a viral infection which changed the physiological mitochondrial energy metabolism mechanism on a cell level, and we finally have more biomolecular research to to show the physiological mechanisms behind exercise prescriptions harming certain groups of people with MECFS. Given the Dr K is a medical doctor, I would generally expect a little more caution in giving this type of advice to a generation of young people who have just lived through a pandemic that caused post viral illness on an extremely large scale.",18,2025-06-21T00:59:14Z

That being said, why are we looking at the ways to respond to that in such an atomized, individualistic way? The solution to this is not to cultivate the traits of stoicism in order to accept your miserable lot in life, but to band together with others who feel the same way and start building mutually beneficial support systems. There is a whole movement underway to make this happen by building mutual aid based support networks, directly democratic people's assemblies, and collectively owned and run communal lands/housing/schools/food gardens/co-op businesses on the neighborhood, local, regional, national and international levels called the communalist movement.

5AB2l8Cehwk,@eddie2000ad,"i empathize with people struggling right now but honest to god a perspective change is needed for some of these people to survive and then someday thrive, it is true a social contract was broken at some point, we built society to circumvent the REALITY that survival is not guaranteed. at any other point point in history you would be working all day every single day just to survive and it STILL wasn't a guarantee. Yes the system has been unfairly optimized but that can change, and you can also change your circumstances to re-balance it back into your favor, in fact you HAVE to do that. that's what survival is, it is unfair that others might be more privileged or have been in the past but like Dr. K stated complaining about it does NOTHING to help you, and i mean that as sympathetically as i can, i want people to survive and get to a better place, so you have to acknowledge the reality, embrace it, then move forward any way you can to try to change it. this seems to be too emotionally heavy for people to cope with but if you just realize that all of the extra stuff was never guaranteed for most of human history  you might find that even the worst case scenario in modern society is still better than 99% of what humanity had, then you might find the strength to act and move forward. it gets better and if you're resilient and creative enough, you can get ahead",12,2025-06-20T23:27:35Z

5AB2l8Cehwk,@iRiDiKi,"""Why You Feel So Drained After Work"" Because it's 8 hours of work...?

Jokes aside, let's be real. If you're unhappy in life, if you feel tired as fuck, etc, you need to sit down, think about what needs to change and make those changes. I've been in bad working environments and it sucks, but now I've found a good working environment, life is a lot easier. Same with home situation - had an abusive parent growing up, managed to do the tough thing and get out (after way too long) and it made life so much better and I could actually start my own journey and growth. It's hard to initially make those changes - I get it, the way you feel is inundating and debilitating -  but it's your responsibility to make the actions instead of continuing to push it off and waiting for things to change on their own. I know people will hate hearing this, but if you're unable to save working 40 hours a week, then maybe you need to cut out some overhead costs and budget better or look for a different job or take a comfort cost and share a place or go study something, etc. That discomfort or extra work or material sacrifice that you make, will be a temporary thing because it's working toward a goal of your choosing and believe it or not, is often not as bad as it seems and may even be good for you - you are more capable than you realise you are. It's up to you at the end of the day.

You do not need to be disillusioned. You don't need to trauma dump and make your connection with your own negative feelings stronger in these comments or in some subreddit. Countries of the western world are the best places to live (seriously, romanticising other places or older times and letting that impact your general mood is just arrogant), politicians and peers do hear us and there are plenty of people trying to make things better. Sadly, things do not get better linearly, but they do get better over time. Keep going, keep putting in effort, do your best to be positive, aim for what is important to you and one day you'll feel that you've made it.",17,2025-06-20T23:26:02Z

But also due to life that hope was then crushed. I promised myself that I will reach the goals I envisioned when I was hopeful, but this feeling of tiredness is overbearing.

When students are asked to guess which of a random sequence of coin flips, and a non-random sequence made by hand, is real, they usually choose wrong.

And due to the high cost of living I stay little far & hence morning, evening car drive timing is minimum (30+30 - 1 hours). My office doesn‚Äôt have s parking. So we park far for free parking. So that takes 20 mins. And the time for home to parking adds another 10 mins. So work + commute take 10 to 10.5 hours.

With sleep it goes to 18 to 18.5 hours. Rest is maximum 5.5 to 6 hours max (this is considering no project deadlines & extra work etc.)

And of this 5.5 hours we need to spend time for kids, spouse too.

I want to spend 2 hours daily to play and 30 mins for gym (only 3-4 days) , 1 hour for exercise warmup & cooldown (stretching, meditation, etc.)

I agree fully your concept of 8/8/8 should be the norm (work timing of 8 hours should include commute too. We are commuting for work & not our personal purpose) globally.

YyjBKqsJqAo,@Gaioehis,"Basically, I‚Äôm a dental student in 4th year (the last two years). I‚Äôve always been among the top 3 students, and last year I was actually ranked first. But recently, I‚Äôve been struggling with so many academic problems‚Äîit feels abnormal.

It started with the fact that I can‚Äôt really remember what I study. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the huge amount of information or what, but I‚Äôve reached the stage of clinical practice where I‚Äôm supposed to understand everything and act quickly‚Äîyet my mind feels completely blank.

Another issue is that I regret being among the top students, because:
	1.	The psychological pressure‚Äîeveryone always expects the best from you, while I personally feel like a total failure.
	2.	Jealousy and exclusion from classmates‚Äîbecause my personality is different. I usually just attend lectures, leave, and I only have one close friend. (I also can‚Äôt tolerate the bad behavior and attitude of many of my peers.)

I tried to befriend them but it didn‚Äôt work. Their personalities drain me, and even when I walk away, they still talk about me. And no, this is not a ‚Äúweak personality‚Äù thing. I‚Äôm naturally calm and cold‚ÄîI literally can‚Äôt give any reaction to anything. To the point that classmates doubt how I‚Äôm among the top students, and some even think I get my grades through favoritism, since I‚Äôm quiet, isolated, and socially awkward‚Äîcall it whatever you want.

The important thing is: lately I feel like I have ‚Äúmental decay.‚Äù Even though I live a healthy lifestyle and take care of myself, I just don‚Äôt know why I feel like throwing myself off somewhere to stop the headache in my head.

I‚Äôve also started feeling dumb‚ÄîI can‚Äôt comprehend many things anymore, and I feel like a complete failure. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve never been appreciated by my environment, no matter how much effort I put in.

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this, but in general, I feel socially stupid yet academically smart‚ÄîI know how to study and get high grades, but I can‚Äôt retain information in my head. And I always feel like everyone else is better than me. That saying, ‚Äútop students are usually stupid,‚Äù is starting to feel true to me.

And honestly, do you want to know why I feel like such a failure? Because I‚Äôm a near-doctor, in 4th year, and yet I didn‚Äôt know how to manage a diabetic teenager who needed an extraction‚ÄîI got a zero. And the professor gave me a look like: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a failure.‚Äù

So yeah, that‚Äôs my situation.",0,2025-09-29T18:15:26Z

Decreased satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.

I work around 10 hours every day plus the hours I take to commute to my workplace. my workplace is very strict with appearance and customer service. and the thing about my position is that I have a ""special"" role, and this means I take more work. before I've got this job, I dealt with serious social anxiety, which I wasn't even able to leave my room in that meantime. It took me about 2 years to ""heal."" and this work has been so stressful that it's making those symptoms of social anxiety appear again. and the worst  part about it is that I can't quit because my parents won't allow me to do so. but now I can't administrate all the areas of my life, I'm not being able to handle college, not being able to handle the workload, not having enough energy to take care of myself, not being able to cultivate relationships even not having time to sleep properly since I wake up at 5am and go to sleep at 11pm. just so I leave my house at 6am to get at work 8:30am and leave work at 7pm.

The job pays well. Earlier this week, I had immediately stopped what I was working on and just took a walk for a few minutes. It was either take a walk or quit on the spot.

I study with full scholarship cause my family is not rich. And in my first year, I failed one important subject, which basically blocked subjects in upcoming semesters. It's okay. I'm going to have to extend my studies by just a semester and likely have to pay for that semester. My family could afford one semester, but not more. What's stressing me out most is that I'm taking this subject again this semester and and I'm afraid of failing it again. I've failed it before just because of a tiny mistake in my lab exam. I've been stressing over it again and again. Because failing it again would be more extension which my family can't afford. Overthinking that I might do mistakes again. But this time, everything is different. I knowy mistake and I'm now even more prepared for that subject. I hope I'll pass this exam and stress will go away. I believe god's on my side.

It's been awfully bad for a longer time now, and (surprise, surprise) it has finally started to affect me. This also for a while now. I'm lucky that I'm at a point in life at the moment that I can turn my somewhat full attention to this.

The rest of the ""list"" is obviously important too. However, I've learnt that concentrating on a few matters at the time, can provide better results, too. In the past I've done that mistake of trying to fix and avoid stress and so on a multiple level. In turn, that became something that ate itself and caused more harm.

YyjBKqsJqAo,@STARPHASE,"I got a full time job late last year, and work 40 hours, and am AT work for 45 hours a week, as I get an hour long lunch. 
I'm not a morning person, and need to wake up at 7 am to make it to work at 8 am. I had to get myself on a real sleep schedule, as my last job I worked 3 days a week, and didn't have to be there until 10am, and lived a mile away. So, I quickly had to adjust to a reasonable schedule. I'm in bed by 10pm, and wake up at 7am. 

I got to work, I come home and shower, then eat, and from about 7-10 I have 'me' time, in whatever form that takes. I also tend to call out one day a month, and have 2 days planned(and approved) off in March, just to give me a long weekend to unwind and reset. 

And on days where I'm really feeling out of it, I'll take a nap on my lunch. I'll eat, and the time I have left after, usually 45-30 minutes, I'll go to my car and nap in the back seat. I did that everyday for the first 2 months of the job. Now it's just an occasional thing. 

I am certainly not cut out fir a full time job, but I've gotta do what I've gotta do. Things could be worse. I like my job, but that doesn't mean I like working 40 hours a week. So I definitely take the extra steps I need to in order to avoid that burnout.",0,2024-02-14T06:02:36Z

YyjBKqsJqAo,@kritinirmesh1466,"I AM suffering from burn-out currently and I can certainly use some help. I am in my last year of senior secondary in India. Exam season is coming closer, and our school just had the 1st pre-board of the season. I have a bunch of competitive exams lined up, starting in January. I thought I was being consistent after experiencing an intense burnout in 11th but ultimately, I am still where I was since the last of board exams in 10th. Honestly, there's some financial issue in my middle-class family and though I love my family, it does not create a good environment for mental health of a teenager who stresses too easily. And if you are an Indian, you would know that Board exams are very crucial for a 12th grader along with the college entrance exams. 

When I talked about my burnout to our school counselor last year exactly around this time, she recommended I take some breaks, try changing my music taste to something upbeat and say positive affirmations. It helped me that time but this time, I'm worried that I've been taking wayyy too many breaks and distracting myself from the stress of studies that I feel like I'm not studying at all. I keep thinking how this is the worst timing for a burnout. And honestly, I think that the burnout never left me since it first affected me in the 2nd term boards of 10th grade.
I my mind I know that I should be studying, but then I suddenly get tired and take a way longer break than intended. I can feel my discipline slipping and when I try to get back at it, I falter in just a few hours. I've been having mental breakdowns because of this recently.

I wanted to discuss this with some sort of professional but considering that I won't be having a normal school day anymore and that I can't afford wasting much time thinking about it, I tried looking online but didn't find anything helpful.

YyjBKqsJqAo,@SimplePhysics00,"I know that this and other videos focus a lot on Work burnout, but I want to say I believe you can experience social burnout too, perhaps even romantic burnout, especially as an introvert. Currently, I feel like I'm experiencing something between the two. I'm a single male in his 30s now, and it is STRESSING ME THE FFFF OUT that I am single again, and what with casual dating in the state it's in, currently in 2022. I am having trouble falling asleep, can't focus on work, and find my every waking moment is filled with thoughts of ""well if I go out and do this or that, maybe I'll meet \*her!\*"" or ""If I was at this place minding my own business, what would I do if \*she\* walked up to me and started talking?!"". I fully realize that these thoughts are just ok - they aren't the healthiest, and they aren't the worst thoughts one could have. But the number/frequency of them that I have, of all different kinds of scenarios... it's just overwhelming. And constant. And honestly annoying. I've gotten to the point where I'm not putting myself out there because I KNOW I'm only doing it to try and do it to find \*her\*. Or someone who I can bother about my needs as a social being. Well, introverted social being, but I still want to be listened to, talked to. I still want to be valued.

So I clicked on this video after several others because I think I'm honing in on this being a burnout problem. I'm burned out over looking for companionship, of hoping to find the *one*, of constantly doubting my every move. I am by no means over this and I have a lot of self work (and self-appreciation) left to do, but this video did make me realize, right at the start, that I need to figure out exactly what is stressing me out, why and how it is doing that, and what I can do to try and resolve it or deal with it. I'm not fully there at the end of that journey yet, but I've started down a path that doesn't look so thick with the weeds of depression or despair. I hope this comment helps someone else find it, and I hope this video finds more people and helps them too. Thanks for reading",0,2022-09-24T05:21:43Z

I have been just gaming, gaming, gaming, just hiding the actual stress that is school and disappointment. How am i supposed to prioritize mental health over school when my entire life depends on school. If i get a bad grade, my parents will get dissapointes and I'll just feel even more depressed and sad. But at the same time, i know deep inside that i shouldn't be so hard on myself, yet even if my grades end up being horrible, what really matters are my end grades at the end of 10th grade which is what actually matters. Actually, its not even school that is the main point, its just that I'm scared to disappoint my parents and live a shitty life all because i couldn't remember one simple thing. I mean to be honest, i dont think school is the only problem, like family issues. But its like 11:50PM and I'm tired so I'm going to bed.

YyjBKqsJqAo,@Carries_Self-Improvement,"I can relate to burnout because I have experienced it from time-to-time for the past five years. I struggle taking time to rest for myself and this has been the main cause of why I feel burned out often. Last year, I started to understand why it's important to rest, but I find it hard putting in the action up to this day. However, I try to think of each day as a new opportunity to attempt giving rest another try and hope I'm able to do so so that I don't get into another burnout again.

YyjBKqsJqAo,@jeffyeung6103,"I've been feeling burnt out for the past 6 months from work. The stress keeps piling on until one day, I went into a mental breakdown. My body triggered some safety mechanism and all my stress melted away, however, at the same time I found it super hard to think straight. That's when I realized if I didn't stop it's going to lead to a long time to recover.

If you're in that state or nearing the state because of constant stress, I recommend taking proper breaks or rest period. No job or school is worth destroying your mental or physical well being. Everything seems so large at that time but later on you realized its not so big at all. I'm quitting my job and going backpacking for awhile. I have enough funds to last me well over a couple months so I'll be taking some time to recuperate. 

If you don't have that opportunity, I recommend following the video. Yet, if its a job, try finding another one. It's not worth destroying your health and well-being over a job. There's plenty out there. If you're in school, follow what the video talks about. Also, maybe think about doing a backpacking trip. You can go on a low budget trip and still experience the world. Don't shirk your responsibility yet make sure it's not the pressure from society, friends, parents or family forcing you into staying at a position you don't want to be.

Burnout is a sign that our body tells us there's something wrong. Something's not right. It's good because then we notice it to start changing our circumstances, routines and lifestyle. You are important and are full of dignity and self-worth. Jesus loves you. You are so important to Him you are worth dying for so that you can know God and be forgiven. Do not give up on yourself. God did not give up on you. You are of great value and worth to Him. Don't give up. If you can't do it, trust in Him. He will give you the strength to keep going each and every day. You are never alone. He is faithful always :) Jesus loves you!",505,2022-03-10T08:14:08Z

YyjBKqsJqAo,@rose.florish,"Posted this right when I needed it :) I hope you take a small moment out of your day to read this, who ever is reading this, cause I promise you It won't be a waste of your time since it's a helpful piece of advice/information, anxiety is like a fitful child, think of a parent at the store and there child is taking a fit over not being able to get candy in the store they want, if the parent gives into the child yelling and screaming, and gets the candy to make them stop throwing a fit, sure it'll make the child be quiet faster, but then the child will learn that taking a fit gets them what they want and will continue to do so and will even get more persistent with it, but if the parent doesn't get the candy then the child will learn that screaming and taking a fit will not get them what they want, if you think of it this way anxiety is a lot like a fitful child, we tend to give into anxiety witch just teaches it that it can get what it wants by throwing a fit, your anxiety usually wants something from you weather that's not hanging out with a friend cause of social anxiety, or not decluttering cause you don't wanna deal with old things, escaping with playing video games, staying on your phone, or looking up your symptoms on google for a little bit of reassurance cause your anxiety is yelling at you to do so, but if you do it anyways and hang out with your friend or choose not to look up your symptoms your teaching your brain that taking a fit won't solve anything, of course at first this may be annoying to hear this child screaming and yelling at you but if you don't give in and keep persistence eventually you will be dealing with little to no anxiety and your fitful child will understand that taking a fit doesn't get them what they want :) hope this helps <3 (tried making it as gender neutral as possible)",7,2022-03-10T07:34:29Z

This summer, I‚Äôm starting my own business offering car washing and odd jobs around my neighbourhood. I‚Äôve made a logo and I‚Äôm working on a leaflet, but I‚Äôll mainly be doing door-to-door sales so I can learn and practise the skills you‚Äôve taught me.

I don‚Äôt have any social media because of my parents, so I can‚Äôt expand online or get into e-commerce just yet. I also have my GCSEs coming up, and my parents are telling me to focus on studying. I‚Äôm going to try and balance both, as well as going to the gym with my friend.

I also have a mentor who‚Äôs a franchiser, and I‚Äôm learning about investing on the side too. Do you think I‚Äôm doing too much?

My goal is to make ¬£2,400 so I can buy a vending machine and earn some passive income while I‚Äôm at school. I‚Äôm planning to make a deal with my headmaster to place it in the lunch room.

tlrrGHj0lqQ,@Applevivo14Pro,"""During my college enrollment, I initially chose History, Geography, and Political Science as my subjects. However, I soon became uncertain and was influenced by a friend who had opted for English Literature instead of Geography. I decided to follow suit and switched to English Literature, abandoning Geography.

Interestingly, prior to college, I had chosen Mathematics in my 11th and 12th grades, but later regretted not pursuing it further. Instead, I reapplied to reinstate Geography as one of my subjects. After two to three months, I redeveloped an interest in English Literature and decided to pursue it alongside Geography and Economics, in addition to History.

Throughout this process, I experienced persistent confusion, indecisiveness, and an inability to maintain focus on a single subject. These symptoms have led me to wonder if I might be experiencing Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).""

Additional points to consider:

- Do you experience difficulties with organization, time management, and meeting deadlines?
- Have you noticed challenges with self-regulation of emotions, leading to mood swings or irritability?
- Are you prone to impulsive decisions or actions, which might be detrimental to your personal or professional life?
- Do you find it hard to maintain focus during conversations, reading, or other activities?

If you identify with several of these points, it may be helpful to consult a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and guidance.",12,2024-11-28T05:43:25Z

Later in life I sought out the diagnosis and treatment (because females will find the hacks stop working later in life because estrogen regulates dopamine)

But‚Ä¶.i digress (as most good adhd‚Äôrs do)

Along my career journey I stumbled into something a few years ago called agile (bet Dan knows this).   Boy did that framework make sense.  Got mg scrum master and then my coach certs.

U have a purity and way to convey the message so profound 
I am asorbing  and it's not conflicting
So to be on point, beyond this degree
Your nature is second nature 
 so refreshing
 love to delve deep into some topics
 to cover your understanding of the internal power of looking within and seeking the introspective guide to channel your highest power but covering that might be a struggle if not highlighting the dependence conflict of societal norms 
To overcome such constructs and beliefs by reinventing your own ideal version of yourself by flowing with your natural born identity not defined by the identity thats been handed down through the stigmas of expectations and reinforced through perceptions of what success is 
creating a fragmented reality 
 your vibrational resonance in hand 
Lacks it's ability to channel the positive by its natural state 
However like a TV the reception is tuned into a negative reloop distorting the frequencies of natural intuition
The person is then overwhelmed by its ability to rationalize it's understanding due to the conflicts of dependence
In which today I pray your work heals and delivers the love to see holistic success in remedying all areas 
Blessings 23 Xmas into 24
U R your godly angelic self 
Talking gas but as above so below 
If you can help me pls 
I think I will be a very interesting subject to unravel my ability to convert negative into positive but I am still lost in parts

As far as self care, I purposely try very hard to always do it to some degree. I know that if I stop that then I've given up everything. I can't always change the circumstances I'm going through that are causing my burn out. But I CAN always choose to take care of myself every day in at least a small way. Self care helps keep me on track, focused on positivity and feeling good about myself. Which in time will help motivate me to do bigger things. 
Self care is like a piece of drift wood I hold onto when I'm out in the ocean drowning in life's circumstances. It's not big, it won't get me out of the water. But it's a little something I can hold onto to at least keep my head a bit above water till my circumstances change and I can finally get out of the ocean",10,2023-05-22T22:11:45Z

And I kept thinking ok, but it keeps getting worse and worse. Finally I start ending up in the nurse a lot, finding myself out of class or skipping classes, or something to avoid school. And people kept telling me to push through and my anxiety will relieve with time. And I find a therapist at one point and she understands me and she helpes me. And she diagnoses me with A.D.D. And when I was with the school therapist she never helped me she always said ‚Äúyour have responsibilities and you need to fulfill them. School is a priority‚Äù and I swear I have always thought society thinks school and education and work is more important than your health‚Ä¶ and when I told the school therapist, at this point my mind felt overwhelmed with emotion and I just wanted to end my life but the school therapist said this over my health ‚ÄúA.D.D. Isn‚Äôt real and that doesn‚Äôt mean you can keep avoiding classes‚Äù


‚Ä¶

I have a condition. That‚Äôs an excuse. And that was my burnout point.



Now I‚Äôm doing better. Ive been on medication to help with my A.D.D. Stoped skipping classes. And protested against that school therapist for running my life. 


























But now that I think about it‚Ä¶ my burnout point was the moment I started to get anxiety and skipping classes and such. Because people weren‚Äôt listening to me.

bcqKV9Wh3t8,@skybug1706,"it's hard to know how to get out of this kind of rut. You can rest for a while but eventually you need to start hauling yourself through the behaviors and building habits and patterns again, right? Like, you can't wait forever to feel ""ready"" to get your life together again, and you have to force yourself manually to go through those motions of self discipline, exercise, duties. I find this very hard and I keep falling off the horse with small successes in between. Hopefully with time and commitment it gets easier, but I do worry I'm doing it wrong and just burning myself out more. But what else can you do yknow?",0,2022-04-27T14:09:43Z

All I did was play one game, go to sleep, and wake up to do the same. My hobbies were nonexistent, my major was nonexistent,  and my classes plummeted. No matter how much I wanted to keep up with life, time sort of flew past me and now I'm paying the consequences. 
I wish I could've taken a break from school, but since I rely on my parents, a ""break"" would've been work or an alternative choice of school. 
In the end, part of my feels grateful for letting things fall apart. Although I felt stuck, I felt like I could breathe. Then again, I know future me will have to deal with the consequences of it. So I don't want to regret this. It honestly felt like my only way out.",0,2022-04-19T03:25:55Z

-so, my best friend suddenly went quiet. I asked him what was wrong or what I did wrong but he didnt answer and it has been WEEKS. I know nothing about him rn. And it troubles me a lot. 
-I did something horrible on the last day of school and I think my, friends deceive and hates me. So I dont have anywhere to tell my feelings too. Ive been bottling up this for weeks and I know it isnt healthy, but idk what to do. I dont want to tell my parents because it might worry them. I have 3 younger siblings that needs them more. Physically, Im still okay but mentally, it is kinda hard to ignore what is killing me inside. I know what my problem is, I know the solutions but Im not sure what I have/need to do.

My name is Olivia and I‚Äôm 13 years old.
Last summer I was diagnosed with depression anxiety and panic disorder.
This video I can definitely relate to because I noticed that I go through all the things in the video but for me the worst one is sleep.
I would go to see a therapist but I‚Äôm too scared to ask my parents as I‚Äôm afraid of them but there are people who I trust, but I can‚Äôt contact them because my parents took my phone away from me. I ha e also been self harming and I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts they keep coming and going. It‚Äôs getting really annoying and stressful but I just get on with it. I do have a couple of video ideas which are more mindfulness because it really helps me before bed and in the morning and the other one is how to get over your fear because my fear is a balloon and I can‚Äôt go near them or look at a picture of them. I have also brought your book and I‚Äôm on chapter 6 and I‚Äôm in love with it. It‚Äôs really detailed and you have put so much effort in it. I wish I could meet you one day but I don‚Äôt think we can. Thank you for all you do, keep up the good work.
Stay safe and sending love and positive vibes to you. Xx üòò",6,2022-04-09T17:40:40Z

menit ke 14an : Kurang setuju dengan masalah jam kerja yg untuk bersaing harus ready 24 jam, beda cerita kalau freelance/serabutan memang harus ready terus.. kalau sudah office hour 9-5 trus diluar jam kerja dituntut untuk standby terus juga ga setuju, itu perusahaannya sudah ngga sehat !! Kalau mau dikontak diluar jam kerja ya boleh, tapi jangan berharap fast respon aja.. 

Ngga usah bilang me time, healing, dll.. Bilang aja family time, terkadang kita diluar jam kerja ga bisa dikontak, ya karena mungkin kita lagi mengembangkan diri dengan baca buku, main game, bersosialisasi dengan teman diluar kantor, bisa aja lagi family time dengan suami/istri/anak/mertua, dan masih banyak lagi..

Jadi buat perusahaan klo mau 9-5 ya diluar jam kerja ga usah nuntut aneh2, kecuali ga usah 9-5 sekalian, dijadiin WFH, itu lebih bisa menurutku.",5,2024-12-12T08:08:18Z

For immediate stress: double inhale and then exhale slowly to lower heart rate. 
For medium term stress: train your mind to calm while the body is working hard (i.e. try to dilate pupils while exercising), to increase tolerance to adrenaline. 
For long term stress: create social connections (to people, animals, or even objects) which trigger feelings of trust when recognised and release serotonin; and take supplements like l-theanine before sleep which reduces activities of thinking mind and enhance depth of sleep.",1,2025-02-09T08:18:11Z

On one occasion, a client with moderate anxiety symptoms responded after the exercise: ""I felt more calm and relaxed in my body, but in my mind was just waitin until it was over so I could go back to being anxious""

I praised client for openness and pointed out how client experienced a shift or change in anxiety whuch, in itself, can be helpful - also that anxiety is not inherently  bad, and can actually function as a 'protecter.'

qUz93CyNIz0,@MrQuadcity,"**Key Insights on Managing Stress & Anxiety: A Neuroscientific Perspective**  
*(Based on the Huberman Lab Essentials Episode)*  

---

### **1. Stress as a Brain-Body Phenomenon**  
- **Stress Defined**: Stress is a generalized system mobilizing brain and body resources when internal experiences clash with external demands. It involves the **sympathetic nervous system** (activation) and **parasympathetic nervous system** (calming).  
- **Neurological Basis**: The **sympathetic chain ganglia** (neurons along the spine) release epinephrine (adrenaline), priming the body for action (e.g., increased heart rate, blood flow to muscles). Conversely, the parasympathetic system slows bodily functions (e.g., digestion) during stress.  

---

### **2. Tools for Immediate Stress Relief: The Physiological Sigh**  
- **Mechanism**: A rapid breathing technique to counteract acute stress:  
  - **Double inhale** (through the nose) ‚Üí **Long exhale** (through the mouth).  
  - **Why It Works**: Reinflates collapsed lung alveoli, expels excess CO‚ÇÇ, and triggers the parasympathetic nervous system to lower heart rate.  
  - **Effectiveness**: Reduces stress within 20‚Äì30 seconds. Repeat 1‚Äì3 times as needed.  

---

### **3. Short-Term Stress: Benefits & Immune Activation**  
- **Positive Role**: Acute stress enhances immune function by releasing adrenaline, which mobilizes infection-fighting cells (e.g., from the spleen).  
- **Tool: Cyclic Hyperventilation (Wim Hof Method)**:  
  - **Protocol**: 25‚Äì30 rapid inhales/exhales ‚Üí Hold breath for 15‚Äì30 seconds (post-exhale). Repeat 2‚Äì3 cycles.  
  - **Outcome**: Boosts adrenaline, combats infections, and reduces inflammatory responses (supported by studies on endotoxin tolerance).  
  - **Caution**: Avoid breath-holding near water; consult a doctor for pre-existing conditions.  

---

### **4. Medium-Term Stress: Raising Stress Threshold**  
- **Stress Inoculation**: Deliberately exposing oneself to stressors (e.g., cold showers, intense exercise) to build tolerance.  
- **Tool: Cognitive Calming Under Activation**:  
  - **Panoramic Vision**: Widen gaze (avoid tunnel vision) during high stress to activate brainstem circuits that reduce mental agitation.  
  - **Practice**: During physical exertion (e.g., sprinting), consciously relax the mind while the body remains activated.  

---

### **5. Long-Term Stress: Mitigating Chronic Damage**  
- **Key Risks**: Chronic stress erodes brain structures (e.g., hippocampus), weakens immunity, and increases cardiovascular risks.  
- **Critical Tools**:  
  - **Social Connection**: Activates serotonin (linked to well-being and neural repair). Prioritize trusted relationships, pets, or activities that spark delight.  
  - **Supplements (Use Judiciously)**:  
    - **Ashwagandha**: Lowers cortisol and anxiety (short-term use recommended).  
    - **L-Theanine** (100‚Äì200 mg): Enhances relaxation and sleep quality via GABA modulation.  
    - **Avoid High-Dose Melatonin**: Disrupts hormonal balance; prioritize natural light/dark cycles for sleep.  

---

### **6. Organizational Framework for Emotional Health**  
- **Three Stress Timescales**:  
  1. **Acute** (seconds/minutes): Use physiological sigh or cyclic breathing.  
  2. **Medium** (days/weeks): Build resilience via stress inoculation.  
  3. **Chronic** (months/years): Invest in social bonds, sleep, and anti-inflammatory habits.  
- **Core Principle**: Stress is neither inherently good nor bad‚Äîits impact depends on *context, duration, and controllability*.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Stress management requires a tailored, science-backed approach:  
1. **Leverage Physiology**: Use breathwork (physiological sigh, cyclic breathing) to modulate acute stress.  
2. **Build Resilience**: Train the mind to stay calm during physical activation (e.g., panoramic vision).  
3. **Prioritize Connection**: Social bonds and serotonin are foundational for long-term emotional health.  
4. **Supplement Strategically**: Ashwagandha and L-theanine can aid stress modulation but are not substitutes for lifestyle fundamentals.  

By understanding stress as a dynamic brain-body interplay, we can harness its adaptive power while mitigating harm. The key lies in *real-time tools* for acute relief, *deliberate practice* for resilience, and *sustained investment* in relationships and restorative habits.

In 2021 got covid, which wasn‚Äôt really bad in terms of symptoms but after 6 month period I started experiencing arrhythmia attacks during exercising, for example: when I was doing high intensity intervals and rhythm goes up and down really quick and then this kinda arrhythmia attack is starting. + I‚Äôm in sports since age of 7, could be a trigger as well.

ECG during this attack said AVNRT type of arrhythmia and I did radio frequency ablation this year. Holter monitor don‚Äôt show super bad things, some extrasystoles (which started to hit me more after the surgery till now, it‚Äôs done 9 months ago) and every time noticed sympathetic nervous system involved into heart beating process.

So, right now I‚Äôm more into trying solve functional nature of arrhythmia which could occur because of stress and other neurological issues. I would be grateful to hear any suggestions and relevant feedback on that. Hopefully we‚Äôll all find a way to be calm and happy",0,2025-01-18T16:53:06Z

VMbhM59K5FQ,@sciencebysjoke,"What pains me a bit when watching this video is that they tall about taking a sabbatical and focussing more on people putside of work, jobbies outside of work, et cetera. Great advice if you're not in a fullfledged burn out and yes it's necessary to move forward in the future to prevent burn out like symptoms again.. 

Buuuuut, I am currently on sick leave because of a very intense, rock bottom burn out. And I can assure you that it's absolutely impossible to invest in ""people outside of work"" and ""cool new hobbies"". Currently I do not even have the mental energy to actually focus on myself, rest and recharge. Focussing on other people is really the last thing I should do as I'm in an actual burn out, not ""close to the edge"". 

So yes, I will take your advice to heart when I'm actually well on the track of recovery. But not now. Because it will make things worse. 

So if you are a fellow person suffering from an actual burn out: you're doing well just focusing on yourself now. Don't push yourself to meet expectations other than resting, giving yourself time and listening to your own body and mind, try to find calm in the chaos. You'll get there eventually, no rush. Other people don't matter now.",1,2025-02-18T01:51:09Z
VMbhM59K5FQ,@sg333ify,"I just came across the video and reading through people experiences. Hoping to find shared expriences perhaps. I work in the UK, more specifically in hospitality. I had been part of the operations throughout the pandemic and found ourselves short of 5x time less people in the team. I was part of the few remaining, but we were expected to deiliver the same level of service as before and I found myself leaving after only 1 year returning from furlough. It felt I was dreading to come to work everyday with email backlogs and just the workload overall. 

Since then I moved to People & Culture field and I have been with another hospitality organisation now for almost 2 years. I thought to be part of the team which promote culture within an organisation might make a difference, but I found myseld with such a workload that it felt unachievable. My managers kept saying it's a rough patch, or we are quite busy at the moment, but in all honesty it was the same all the time. We kept on being told that the organisation was not profitable and that we were being inefficient. I worked lots of overtime, paid and not paid, to compensant. It's really hard now because while being told that we are not making money we were finding ourself paying the people of top 0.5 million with a 100% bonus at the end of the year. The ratio between the lowest earner and the top earner was 1:23. Anyhow, it felt good to be able to relate to symptoms of burnout, I felt truly seen and I feel less lonely. I thought I was being weak for not being able to 'handle the heat', most definitely when my manager told me other people were handling it while I seemed not.

The company isn't making as much money as they were expecting, so it's understandable (fair) that the lack of hours is what I'm experiencing. My sense of reward has been screwed up far before I ever got into the workforce.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@princepeterwolf,"This is about the third video that is ""explaining"" a topic in a really poor manner, I have no idea what the hell she's talking about, seems very superficial to what I've experienced. I've went through burnout myself, and I'm still recovering. With me, it was a high level of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion, I was completely drained. I reached a point where I completely dissassociated from my body. I was with my partner, and he was talking to me, calling me, even held me, and I completely was unable to move or react or reply. I would often feel extremely anxious on not knowing where I'd be able to find any kind of energy or strength to face the next day. I was working about 12 to 14 hours per day, I very often worked during weekends and on holidays. This went on for basically five years. I eventually starting having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. This all culminated on a stroke I suffered this March, and I've been recovering ever since. I've been seen by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a neurologist, a general practice doctor...did countless exams and been on different medication since. I took a medical leave of 2 months after my stroke, and went back to the same job afterwards. Needless to say, it very quickly started all getting the same again. Yes, the feeling of unffairness was there, but that exists in every aspect of your life, what is really fair anyways? Extrinsic rewards or whatever she was talking about, seeking some kind of appreciation for what we're bringing on to the table? I think that's pretty normal. So again, don't understand how that's a symptom. On my end, if I would offer any kind of advice is: if you ever feel, and here's the important part, not a bit or not just occasionally, but often terribly overwhelmed, do something about it right away: communicate it to your line manager; try to do your job during your working hours and if it proves to be impossible communicate that to your manager; If even after you established boundries, and provided regular and formal feedback on what's happening and nothing changes: LEAVE. Leave before it gets worse, before your body and your health forces you to. No job is worth your life. I was an overachiever, constantly trying to do everything and as much as possible, constantly wanting to be the best possible employee I could be, constantly trying to help everyone around me, constantly trying to push myself and telling myself that I was strong enough to endure anything. Look where that got me...and yes I did leave my job three weeks ago. I'm now taking some time off and recovering at home with my partner, and I'm still struggling on a day to day basis, but I can see some small improvements already and I believe in a few months I'll hopefully start feeling better and more like myself.",1,2024-10-24T18:23:43Z

VMbhM59K5FQ,@catstickler,"1:17: So I was diagnosed with depersonalization/derealization disorder over a decade ago. Fortunately, most of the symptoms are gone, thankfully, because it's disconcerting to experience those dissociative symptoms randomly.

How my therapist described it to me (and my own lived experience) was that depersonalization is like living in a waking dream where you're there but not really there. Reality doesn't feel real, and neither do you. Like when I looked down at my hand, I wouldn't recognize it as MY hand during an episode. It was like I was disconnected from my body and sometimes felt as if I were floating outside of myself, completely disengaged from my own senses/experiences.

I didn't experience that sense of cynicism like she talked about, though. I guess the closest to that I experienced was just feeling emotionally numb, but that was a feeling of nothingness, like my emotions were under a frozen lake. They're there, but I just can't access them to FEEL them.

Feeling a sense of cynicism would be actually feeling that emotion, though.

I have no doubts that my chronic stress intensified the symptoms of depersonalization (not feeling like a person) and derealization (not feeling that reality is real), though. I just didn't have the phrase ""burnout"" in my vocabulary 15+ years ago.

I wonder if she just misspoke when she said ""depersonalization.""",0,2024-10-21T06:59:10Z

I was too embarrassed to ask my references again, so soon for a reference, I knew I was locked into a horrible situation for 1+ y at least, because it is not appropriate to quit, I needed the money, I needed the shift schedule, and I didnt want to bother my references after what one told me was quite a lengthy process, for a horrible horrible job.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@tamitami479,"I cried when you listed all the symtom that I have them all studying at Uni, master degree. The degree that I paid a lot of money for. Getting not much but despression
1. Increased workload: everyone in Uni can imagine how much the workload is, you not just study, you deal with assessments (sometimes they are stupid), deal with classmates who lazy, just want to pass and you do all the tasks
2. Values mismatch: Me and my classmates in the same group but have different value, i need high grade, they just need to pass, they dont care, but I care. The professor is saying groupwork is like your work environment. Not it is not, I dont get pay for this. I paid for this education and receive anxiety.
3. Unfairness: I rememer we had a test in class. The Prof said we marked ourseves. There are students adjusted their anwers and even used chatGPT. I did not and I was angry. My prof said it is nothing to do with me. I should focus on myself dont care about others. If I work at a place shitty like that, I will leave. Too bad, I cannot drop my study. Stupid assessment
4. Sense of reward: Unfair. Teachers dont care either. The system is stil the same even after we gave feedback. 

I am tired. I dont want to study anything. You may say im playing victim. I even if I am or not. I dont know what is wrong with me so I dont care what you will say to me. I just dont want to get out or my room, dont want to meet anyone. I doubt myself who chose this course to study. I even blamed myself decided to study abroad. I hope end of this degree, I will be back to happy-me. I hope I wont change. I hope I wont living life so angry that telling others not to choose this uni to study. Study is the best thing that happened in my life. Now it is disapointing. I am angry. I should not pay that much for this course. Now how to fix me?

It makes it difficult to have a reasonable discussion  when some people think it's just sort of feeling tired alot and others such as olympic athletes have lower cortisol responses leading to severe near mobility impairing paralysis, severe sleeping disorders, while their bodies check out as perfectly healthy under lab tests.  Serious medical studies focus on air traffic controllers, medical doctors, and military veterans who actually get exercise and sleep yet show burnout symptoms while common word choice by college students is ""I'm so burned out"" because they haven't slept enough, pulled all nighters, etc.  People are using the same words to describe vastly different things is a huge problem with the word ""burnout"".",0,2024-03-16T22:51:06Z
VMbhM59K5FQ,@mikahundin,"The conceptualization and recognition of burnout vary significantly between countries, notably between Sweden and the USA. These differences reflect broader attitudes towards work, mental health, and well-being, as well as the influence of healthcare systems and cultural norms on the understanding of psychological syndromes.

### Sweden

In Sweden, burnout is recognized with a particular emphasis on its severe physiological and psychological impacts. The Swedish approach to understanding and treating burnout includes:

- **Medical Recognition:** Burnout is recognized as a serious medical condition that can lead to profound physical and mental exhaustion, significant memory loss, inability to concentrate, and even physical incapacity to perform daily tasks.
- **Symptomatology:** The symptoms associated with burnout in Sweden encompass more than just emotional exhaustion or cynicism related to work. It includes severe symptoms such as changes in brain function, memory loss, and an overall inability to function in daily life.
- **Treatment Approach:** Sweden has specialized clinics for the treatment of burnout, indicating a structured healthcare approach to address the syndrome. The treatment is comprehensive, potentially involving medical, psychological, and occupational interventions.
- **Cultural Context:** The Swedish approach reflects a broader societal recognition of the importance of work-life balance, mental health, and the physiological impacts of chronic stress.

### United States

In the United States, the understanding of burnout, particularly in the medical and occupational context, has traditionally been more focused on the psychological aspects, though this is expanding:

- **Definition:** Burnout in the U.S. is often defined by the World Health Organization's description focusing on three main dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, primarily in the context of the workplace.
- **Recognition and Treatment:** While awareness of burnout is increasing in the U.S., it has not traditionally been recognized as a medical diagnosis by itself in the general healthcare system. Treatment and recognition might vary greatly depending on the healthcare provider, with a focus often placed on stress management, mental health counseling, and lifestyle adjustments.
- **Research and Discussion:** The discussion around burnout in the U.S. has been growing, especially in the context of workplace wellness programs and within specific professions with high levels of occupational stress, such as healthcare and technology.
- **Cultural Context:** The U.S. work culture, which often values long hours and high productivity, may contribute to the prevalence of burnout. However, there is an increasing push towards recognizing the importance of mental health and work-life balance.

### Comparison

The key differences between Sweden and the USA in defining and treating burnout lie in the recognition of the condition's severity and the scope of symptoms considered. Sweden's approach is more medicalized, recognizing severe physiological symptoms and changes in brain function as part of the syndrome. This leads to a comprehensive treatment approach that includes specialized clinics. In contrast, the U.S. has traditionally focused on the psychological aspects of burnout, with a growing but still evolving recognition of its seriousness and implications for health care and workplace policies.

Both countries are moving towards a better understanding and management of burnout, reflecting a global shift in recognizing mental health as a critical component of overall well-being. However, Sweden's approach, by including more severe symptoms and a structured healthcare response, indicates a more advanced recognition of burnout as a significant health issue that requires specialized treatment.",0,2024-03-16T22:49:23Z

VMbhM59K5FQ,@sjordan7085,"Burnout  can happen from work, life in general as well as medical care. I am retired, and the first two do not apply, but  after serious illness, I became overwhelmed by continuous medical intervention, month after month. It started with being misdiagnosed twice over a two year period, cancer surgery, radiation therapy, Radiation Disease, and  treatment for incontinence issues  made worse by having my bladder toasted. After tweaking my diet from being vegetarian to eating plant-based whole foods, organic where possible, high fiber, low fat, low protein, no sugar, processed foods or alcohol, along with taking a few supplements,  and losing 40lbs, my Oncologist was so impressed.  She told me that my risk of recurrence is  now only 3%. Something she repeated during my last three or four surveillance appointments.
 I consulted her about Bulkamid, but have so far, taken prescription med,  declined PT, had a Metronic Interstim device implanted, bladder botox, a pessary, and Bulkamid. Symptoms have  improved a little, certainly not enough to  significantly improve my quality of life. In fact, I have another appointment with the GynUrologist next month. She will likely suggest more Bulkamid injections, and/or a  urethral sling. I also see my PCP for  a couple of chronic conditions. After reaching the two year cancer survival mark, I decided stop surveillance appointments. My Oncologist is highly respected, so I feel able to trust her, when she says my cancer is very unlikely to return. Of course,  she expressed looking forward to seeing me.
 Dealing wth other medical issues is more than enough to cope with, especially when I am keen to live life free of medical intervention. I have had enough of frequent and serious medical mistakes.  Enough is enough, and as soon as I can stop seeing the GynUrologist who  custom programmed my Interstim, which was not working, I intend to do so. Instead, I'll continue to  spend my time persuing a healthy lifestyle. I have no interest in Cancer Support Groups, and see no reason to look back. I am ' the  Captain of my ship.' That said, I am grateful for a  few counseling sessions, which helped me reinvent my life to be in alignment with my values, and get the most, 'bang for my buck' from whatever time remains.

I was not only emotionally exhausted, depersonalized or having a sense of ineffectiveness. It was WAY beyond that! 
It was TOTAL cognitive shut down and emotional strain. I absolutely couldn't process any more piece of information or develop thoughts on anything. It led me to severe depression and complete passive response to any stimuli. And that was not because I didn't try, it was because *really could NOT*, it was simply beyond my capacity at the time. It seemed like being a zombie...
I suffer from severe memory loss (both short-term and long-term) nowadays, I can't even work for 4 hours a day in the 4-day-week system now and still have to deal with the absolute same conditions that led me to that (living with elder complicated parents who seem to live in a parallel reality) - I can't afford my way out of it because I am an autistic adult with severe ADD (inattentive type) who can't be ""normal"" so can't find any position that would suit me. 
Does anybody can give a further insight about what my issue is? I suspect everything derives from autism (diagnosed lvl 1 but most prolly lvl 2 since I can't understand much non verbal communication, actually almost none at all). 
Oh, I am from Brazil by the way. The discussion on mental health is way lower than that from the USA and elsewhere. No proper treatment unless you are rich and way less social understanding / compassion. It's you for yourself only. The law of the fittest. Can't survive? BUMMER!",0,2024-02-24T15:52:15Z

VMbhM59K5FQ,@solarwinds-,"Most of burn out is caused by greed and not because of our system. Our system is a good one. The problem is it's no longer enough to do a good job. You must do more to be considered to be a good employee. For example, my uncle was a history teacher. The school had no driver's ED program so he started one and ran it. That's what I mean by you must do more. My uncle was lucky in that he had the talent to see the situation and then instigate it. It's ridiculous that every employee must also do the same. You must ""SEE"" where there is a need in your company, then meet that need. You can't just do a good job for which you were hired. If you don't have this talent,  you do not have blessings of the company you work for. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE USA's SYSTEM. The system we have here is a good one. The problem is the people who vote for the idiots who got us into this mess. I remember, we used to have 2 weeks vacation, 1 week sick pay, we had excellent health insurance, we had secure jobs FOR LIFE and a guaranteed retirement.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@Stridefully,"Honestly, all I feel towards my day job is cynicism. I went into it knowing it was the wrong field, but I took it because it was relatively easy to get hired into. My passions lie ENTIRELY in technology and in the arts, and I'm in something entirely unrelated to either. There's little room for me to be creative and do what I love.

It also doesn't help that my workplace isn't exactly autistic/ADHD friendly, as most with most workplaces. And it feels like once I get used to my workload/hours, more gets added on, and I'm back to square one in trying to readjust.

Lately, it feels like each individual task and interaction feels like mentally running a marathon. When I get home I don't have the energy for hobbies, and even scrolling on my phone requires a substantial amount of effort, much less doing anything productive. I'm on a short fuse the vast majority of the time, both at work and outside of work. I find myself breaking down often once I'm alone.¬†

My workplace doesn't offer me any PTO because I'm JUST under the number of hours needed to be considered full-time, and I get patronized when I say I need time off. (Seriously, part-time employees need PTO too, not offering it not only leads to burnout but encourages people to come to work SICK and spread illness!)

But seriously, being burnt out is a consistently awful and tiring feeling. It's also quite isolating. The only person in my life that I can talk to is my partner, who sees my meltdowns, and luckily is very kind, compassionate, and understanding. He's been suggesting I quit for months now.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@Xcizior,"if you are burnt out, its not your fault. we are in a perpetual two way stream. one keeps the upper class on top, and punishes anything and everything in the lower class. being homeless in the USA is now illegal. and because of this push, prisons are full of people who dont belong there. these people can no longer vote to change their lives for the better, and are used as literal slave labor. 

modern day slavery in plain sight. of COURSE you are burnt out. life has become either work for slave wages, doing a several jobs just to make rent and MAYBE food needs, or become homeless to be thrown in prison and used as an actual slave.

 most people only get around 57 hours a week to themselves, while the rest is spent doing bs, dead end jobs that we either dont need to function, we have the ability to automate, or have an ability to improve but wont due to the money to be made. why bolster saftey and ease of use when you get a big fat paycheck in stock buybacks and the like? its an appalling amount of freedom per week in what so many of us proudly proclaim to be the country built on and that thrives on freedom.

 three fourths of millennials are stuck living paycheck to paycheck through no fault of their own. THREE-FOURTHS. there was an npr paper that found millennials werent the reason for mass failure of businesses, but that they simply had no cash to put back into the economy due to garbage pay and high rents. Another part examined the fact that they were not just lazy and entitled but incredibly hard workers- almost double their parents. wages are garbage, and businesses tout record profits while rewarding workers with empty rewards like buisiness bucks or a pizza party instead of better wages- the 'record profits' that the business made were just the pay owed to workers, stolen and handed out to the ceos, boards, and shareholders. 

  we have seventeen MILLION empty houses in the united states, but only six hundred thousand homeless people, and instead of housing people in said buildings/homes, the money is spent on keeping people out and fixing the outward appearance(like the LA office buildings that just got tagged up). instead of houses being worth around 80k, most are over 500k. in 1940s LA, a home for a family of three was a little over 7,000 dollars. every single inch of our economy is broken. the entire thing. it doesnt matter how many new jobs we got or how high employment retention/numbers are if a teen fresh out of college cant even pay rent.


super sobering fun fact- in 1950s NYC- the center of industry and commerce, the most expensive place to live- a single hour of minimum wage could get you a motel room and a hot meal. a single hour. ONE. our current min wage is 7.25 and has been since 09. not even a $50 minimum wage today could pay for a motel room and a meal like that.

if you are burnt out, its not your fault. until these things are fixed, until everyone has the cash to live freely again via ubi or gmi or something as powerful, its going to continue this way. you deserve better. nothing is wrong with you- the system you grew up in and were prepared for doesnt exist anymore, and trying to still force fit yourself into those standards are literally killing you, while also costing our economy 2 trillion a year.",0,2024-02-10T01:24:33Z

At the end of the week I told my supervisor what was going on and decided to take a leave of absence to get things figured out. I went back to therapy and also paired with a career coach. That month changed my life. I felt like I had to rebuild myself entirely, and my therapist and coach helped me realize I needed to be doing something different. My company couldn't support my new career goal so I ended up taking a huge leap and leaving the company to pursue my new career hoping a new company would take a chance on me with little to no experience. I'm so much happier and at peace with my new career and company. I'm so blessed that I had a supervisor who supported what I needed and gave me the space to do it.

Because if I were living like myself, I would've been very happy with my plus one results, which was a full A plus. But instead, I was sad, or I don't know, I was acting sad. These factors and other things I did, made me seem 'smart' to others. And that made high hopes for me by others and a part of myself too, but that was that 'made up' part I guess. And one other thing I hate about myself is the fact that how much I hated being left behind or others excelling ahead of me. And I'm realising that I'm basically downright jealous of others'excellence. Everyone around me seems like they are approaching me with the feeling that I'm some intelligent person. Maybe that's just me making myself seem superior. But deep inside, I know who I really Am. I used to and I still do smirk at others like they are beneath me, and they're wasting their life by not doing 'productive' things. And now, I feel like I'm, just them, but in a different package. Everyone around me is giving me, and looking at me with high hopes. But I feel really heartbroken when I realise that I'm basically nothing. I feel really sorry for my parents that they've raised me for this, and I'm really desperate that I'm treating them like this. I didn't deserve that style of proper parenting. My parents are perfect. They are ideal parents. But I didn't deserve that kind of a treatment. They are worrying about me, right now. And we say that we forget things when we don't revise them. I know it, I've felt it, I've been there, and also being there right now. I honestly forgot how I was before my eleventh grade started. And I feel like I got locked by myself from my true identity. I fear that I will never be the same. I really miss that part of me. Now I don't know whether I got that me still inside of this self or not. I'm sorry.

If someone else is feeling the same way, I'm just saying that, things will become alright. I'm posting this because, someone's sorrows could be a little comforting to another person who may be feeling or going through a similar situation. If hope isn't around, make our own.",0,2024-02-04T11:32:27Z

No friends to hang out with, maybe some drinking buddies who'd praise allah if you'd fall asleep and they found some markers to draw dicks on your face and empty your wallet.
Nothing to do as most hobbies cost money you don't have. Because companies prefer to make profit, hijacking whatever hobbies you used to enjoy.
Video games? Unfinished early access games released and sold at full retail price with a catalogue of DLCs released to fix the game later on. Make them as addictive as possible with microtransactions, a toxic base of players, chest drops, gacha ball dispenser mechanics to keep people spending money on it.
Netflix and chill? Or tiktok/youtube and drool for the remaining time you have left in the day with your energy levels feeling like they're in the negative.

Lifetime unemployed, apart from a short stint being exploited for government subsidies that are paid to employers for employing a cripple. Identifying strongly with all of the symptoms and couldn't figure out why the hell someone who's been labelled as unemployable gets burnout. And then, the third cause drops. Unfairness. 

That sense of being treated as WORTH LESS than others around you unfairly, of being ostracised and overlooked unfairly, of seeing everyone else around you moving forward but having no such opportunities yourself. Because apparently losing a genetic lottery means people get to treat you unfairly. Now you can't do that because of their skin colour, or their sex. Oh no. That would be bad. But if they're disabled? Oh the military won't have you, forget anything that requires a physical like police or emergency services, small business owners will say to your face that they can't take the risk of you falling over at work and suing them. Corporate and public institutions will take your applications, meet with you and then employ an able bodied person, not you. Every time. You have no idea how cynical I feel about people. How much distaste and anger I have built up over time toward society. How much despondency and futility I feel, every day. Full on emotional exhaustion is my default position. I don't even bother to look at people any more, let alone talk to them. Seriously I've been feeling those symptoms she described for two decades. It's just my normal day. 

I don't know if it's that sense of futility talking but I can't even see a way to address this. I'm not part of any organization to make changes within. If I could just figure out how to take a sabbatical from the prejudice others show me, I would. Well other than the method I have employed, which is complete social isolation. Then again I look around at other people and how the world is going and you know what? I feel some small comfort that I don't fit in with it at all.

But I have an entire full time job going on at home trying to rescue and spay/neuter local cats and kittens- which I do not have the funds, resources, or time to do either but I can't look an animal in the eyes that is asking for food/shelter/help and say ""No!""- so my feelings of burnout are entirely related to my physical and emotional exhaustion from trying to live in a world that doesn't allow time to work and run a home. If everyone in the house is at work all the time, and just playing catch up on sleep and the most necessary of chores, then how is any home supposed to actually thrive?

I am 44 and have no idea how I've hung on and made it past not k*lling myself at age 4 or 5; my burnout from overwhelming mental illness is going on almost 45 years with especially the last 3-4 years I've been living in an almost endless psychosis.

 Getting ""help"" here means you wait about a year to get an initial visit at a mental health facility, because of the massive influx of people moving into this area the last few years; which is only to get your insurance info and such and THEN months later you'll get your first visit with a dr. A few months ago after not going to even any medical doctor for about 10 years I went to my family doctor for help in complete desperation, and she gave me 90 days of Paxil, which I took as directed like a fool. My doctor warned me they would not give me refills until I saw a mental health specialist, and they weren't kidding. So even though they personally knew it would take a year/year and half to see one (she literally agreed with me on the wait time), they gave me meds and then cut me off of them after the 90 days. Try going thru the deepest, darkest unending mental breakdown/psychosis while also coming down off Paxil. Physically for weeks after stopping Paxil, it physically felt like clusters of little explosions going off inside my head all the time, I was so deep in a bleak mental hole that i was literally going and sleeping in my yard in 25 degree weather at night, i blew thru any bit of money I had left so badly that I am screwed for at least probably the next year in being able to afford literally anything and as punishment to myself for just being me during the depths of my psychosis last month I chose not to renew my prescription plan this year and now have no access to any kind of prescription medicine regardless of what it is.
I could never explain in any way to anyone the utter hell my life and brain is. I genuinely don't know if I even exist or if anything even exists at this point, but I hang on for my mother and for God. 

I genuinely hope people reading this have access to help, and that you get help early in life. If things are bad for you now...FIND HELP. Don't be me. Thank you for videos like this that may encourage people who can get help to actually get it.",0,2024-01-18T04:28:54Z

VMbhM59K5FQ,@effervescentrelief,"Frequent organizational change is commonly a cause for burnout. Mergers, acquisitions, and frequent management change are very well documented as being triggers of burnout. I've been going through a merger/acquisition/management change for the past 2.5 years at my job and I am close to losing my mind some days. Things seem to be settling a bit finally, but to make matters even more ""nuanced"" I was also diagnosed with adult ADHD very recently because I was struggling so much (I've speculated most of my life but never sought a diagnosis) and sought some help. I think it's why after companies get bought out or merge many people jump ship. I think the change, on top of doing their job, burns people out and they leave. I've sort of made the mistake to hang in there. Don't downplay personal life issues as well. Got two kids on the spectrum, a spouse with some health concerns luckily nothing too major, and then combine all this with the ""wonderful"" state of the economy and world, and it's a recipe for disaster for most people. I'm only hanging in right now because the job seems to finally be getting to where things might actually settle down, being recently ADHD diagnosed and starting meds I'm going to let that ride for a bit, and I'm just going to hang in there a little longer to see what's up.

(9) Only tell trusted friends & family.

*Schedule mental breaks accordingly:* 
_(I will feel mentally fatigued more easily, even with my strategies for efficiency.)_

After 2.5 months into the school year I would feel the burnout kick in. Emotional and physical burnout but had to keep pushing through it didn't matter how I did it I just had to inch it through minute by minute -it was tough. Brain felt like it was fried - body numb and constantly working in an exhausted state. No holidays - no breaks. Just kept working and taking on more projects for my future. Learned my coping mechanish was working more after 5 years in the program which did not help with my burnout cycle. I liked working though so what could I do?

Just glad I can take short breaks now and go on vacation or sick days and not think about work after work. It takes a long long time to heal after a extended burnout. It's not much but 10 days a year and paid holidays is still better than nothing. Finally have time and a bit of money saved (am frugal) to go where I want when I need to get away. She is right -- having a life outside of work/career is so important and can be difficult if you have no safety net. 

The US companies needs to change for sure. The US companies gave nothing.. no holiday pay, no PTO, 3 sick days..

VMbhM59K5FQ,@MultiTipsie,"Hi There, Although I like and agree with the content, too bad it only is reflected from a job standpoint. Also, the proposed solution to handle a beginning burn-out is only reachable when you have money and a boss who is emphatic. In real life, the situation is very different from that. Lots of people have no money even to go on a prolonged holiday, or a holiday at all, let alone a sabbatical! Next to this, telling your boss you need more time for your family or yourself will not be received well! It will only give you more tension at work!
And I know, because I've been through years of all kinds of these situations and advices,  only to see that those didn't match reality and made things worse!

Now I am at home with C-PTSD, no life goals, no money, no friends, no partner (and without money you will never ever get one as a man! Only by lying and that's exactly a point I hate in people!). Only negative things, no positive to compensate for those and to give a sense of live is worth something! So I am 51 and my road of live ended about 4 years ago already. Only to stay alive as to not hurt my kids, who live with my ex-wife, so I also do not see them much). The rest of the time I am just sitting at home, waiting for my live to pass and finally get the rest I want when I die! No health care organisation brought anything they claim in brochures or on their websites! Also organisations that relay people to those others are convinced everything is as it looks. When complaining it is not, they just say you are the one who is lying and keep continuing relaying people to organisations who do not do a thing! Only cashing money for a few months and leave the patient or client just as they were before or even worse!

So, How do you address these things? I am not the only one I guess and there must be thousands of people like me around!",0,2023-10-29T14:35:19Z

Laurie presents the issue as one in which the afflicted should take measures to deal with it, to care for one's self, but often you can't.  You may not have a receptive boss or can quit if need be.  Or maybe one had a family member become disabled and you became a caregiver and are  burned out from that increased work load.  Again, what can one do when so many of the solutions are pay gated and you cannot get the help you need if you can't afford it?  It's one thing to recognize the issue, but it becomes even more insidious of an issue when the way things are handled here, there may not be a solution other than just having a mental breakdown and pulling away from everything and everyone.

Put a foot in front of the other and do the next thing on the list, or the next thing in front of me. I went to ""I need to hold on until XYZ"" to ""oh well.."" kind of knowing what I had to do, but too much stress at some pint just led to feeling numb to everything waiting for my turn to live...

VMbhM59K5FQ,@mermanasmr8566,"I will not talk about Clinical Burnout here, but of a ""burnout"" that many young people consider to be a ""true burnout"", for example when ""gamers"" play a single game for months just to gain clicks. Your brain is just getting bored of your own repetitive actions and goes to sleep. It's telling you ""I'm bored, please do anything else than grinding in a lame game for viewers"". You see, there are patterns in our brain that are 1. Getting bored of repetitive actions (for example, visual signs, like the look of a girl's hair insted of the girl herself, some food, ""grinding""; so called ""secondary stimuli"", like if you eat the same food every day you will hate it in the end) or 2. Never get bored of it (chemical or biological stuff, so called ""primary stimuli""). If you keep thinning your secondary stimuli, you will ALWAYS get bored (or ""fake burnout""). The primary stimuli will always give you pleasure, but, often, at the cost of your life (drugs). For example the biological primary stimuli like peeing - people never get bored of that, which is used by techiques like yoga - yoga and sports do know that it's impossible to get tired of breathing, peeing or the pain in your muscles after gym. So. Once you try falling in a barrel from Niagara Falls, instead of ""grinding"", or just taking a walk or a vacation in a different place (which means you change your secondary stimuli into something else), you will forget all of your ""pseudo burnout"".

VMbhM59K5FQ,@butwhytho4858,"DO NOT listen to this lady. This is THE WORST BURNOUT VIDEO IVE EVER SEEN‚Ä¶

I was looking for something to explain to my husband exactly what burn out is. This video started out OK but you quickly begin to realize, this woman has a job that allows her to take half a year off. This woman has no children and can sit around and play guitar hero to relieve herself from burn out‚Ä¶.

This might be the most tone, deaf thing I have ever watched. I do not dislike this woman and I do not think this was intentional. But because of her nature of work it‚Äôs not really acceptable. I understand cool it was hard and I believe everybody got burned out in some way or another. I‚Äôm still suffering from it, and I‚Äôm trying to figure it all out, you guys probably are too. But most of you did not get to check out whatever you do in life to get yourself back on track.  

Now, here‚Äôs the next thing, I realize her target audience may not have a lot of marriages or parental issues. Some of you were just too young or haven‚Äôt reached that part of your life. Were you ready for that. That‚Äôs OK. But what a video like this does tells you that it‚Äôs OK when you have a family with responsibilities and a job that doesn‚Äôt give you a sabbatical, to take care of just yourself and maybe play some guitar hero. 

I think it is important for everyone out there, especially the ones that do not know what burnout in parenting is light to understand us, and she totally didn‚Äôt touch on it. It‚Äôs important to note for your future because you don‚Äôt know it until you liv it. 

My husband is a firefighter and works sometimes three days at a time which prevents me from having a normal job. It prevented me from having a job at all during Covid shut downs, and during two hurricanes in Louisiana living in a camper. 

Psychologist call what I do, third shift. It means even after your job is over. You still have to pick up another shift because a family is work, it‚Äôs actually harder work than showing up to work, going mindless and making a paycheck most of the time. 

The hardest part of parental burn out is when parenting no longer feels rewarding and the guilt of that crushes you because you love your children, so why aren‚Äôt you happy? Why isn‚Äôt this rewarding? 

What do you do all summer long when you‚Äôre exhausted and burn out but your kids have been out of school for three months. You have no free. Will besides a little wiggle room around the house. Doctors appointments that appointment laundry dishes floor care getting the kids in the bath or the shower washing the dogs cleaning toilets . That‚Äôs just a list a few things. And at the end of the night after everyone has been bathed, you make sure everyone brush their teeth and got a snack before they brush their teeth‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to be about 10 o‚Äôclock. At that point you have to decide. Would you like some free time to do anything like watch a YouTube video or do you have enough energy to stand up and take a shower because the shower is your free time.

So to get through the next day, you tell yourself it‚Äôs OK they will grow at one day and you will have time to yourself again. That bought goes along with extreme guilt and depression, knowing that your children are growing up and then one of a teenager and will leave the house eventually and you will have missed all this time with him just feeling awful and wanting something for yourself. That sense of loss and selfishness will crush you if you have any hard at all. 

 This might have been the most misinformed self, entitled, Toni death video on this I have seen. Again, I do not mean that to hurt this woman, but until she hears it somewhere, she will never understand that, and in her line of work, she really should take that into account massively. Just like I hope some of you hear who might not have a family or those type of responsibilities, well understand and take it incredibly serious, and even consider what you would do in a situation like this. Because there is no time to space out and play games or take a week off or even a half a year off from your job your job is a stay at home parent who pays bills cooks claims and does literally everything except bring home a check and get a break from the house. Think about it and have a plan.",0,2023-08-19T22:25:33Z

Simply work to live, not live to work. But that breaks the ideology of everyone must be seen to be successful and display it through consumption, material and social experiences.

I have debilitating levels of burnout to where I can‚Äôt do anything at home anymore except play games and detach entirely. Some days I‚Äôm too exhausted to do that. I drank for 11 years to help cope with the immense pain customer service jobs have put me through. I hate people. If I‚Äôm not at work I‚Äôm dreading the next day I have to go back even if it‚Äôs a week away. I‚Äôve worked construction, warehouse, distribution, factory, customer service, delivery driver, etc. and there are hardly any differences. College is financially impossible now. I am a phenomenal worker (I have OCD) so I am extremely efficient in what I do. I pick up on things quickly but I PICK UP ON THINGS QUICK so I can see very quickly when something will become a major problem. I‚Äôve done it all but there is no solution. Society has essentially killed me inside. My dream is to get a house in the middle of the woods and coming out only for the bare minimum of supplies. Me and my partner are both done. He‚Äôs still got his empathy but mine is gone. A man had died and left his boat at our lake, when his wife came to get it she kept talking about him and apparently I said my thoughts out loud.

Also, reasons for burnout can also be propagated by management  e.g. in my previous company management segregated people on some criteria behind peoples back thus making bad relationship between colleagues, good workers were not recognized because their opinion on product quality (and how product should be developed) was  marked as ""unwanted"" by management...

VMbhM59K5FQ,@shayne_has_landed2511,"I find that the exhaustion caused by the current state of the US laboring system is causing more burnout in the population. However, due to increasing acceptance of mental health conditions and the resulting spread of easily accessible mental health information to the public, people who are simply experiencing exhaustion have been classifying themselves as ‚Äúburnt out‚Äù. As someone who experiences clinical burnout, this has brought me to many personal experiences when in telling someone I am burnt out, there is an expectation placed upon me to simply ‚Äúkeep going‚Äù. The misidentification of burnout by those experiencing exhaustion leads to the belief that burnout is simply a period of low energy, and not a potentially dangerous mental health condition. This then leads to the mistreatment of those experiencing clinical burnout, placing them in a position that may worsen their condition.

There is also a heavy expectation, which this video promotes, that burnout is a set of specific symptoms that occur in a neurotypical format. In reality, especially for those who are neurodivergent, burnout is a collection of ranging symptoms that have the ability to fluctuate. Burnout for a neurodivergent brain is going to show a different collection of potential symptoms than those identified for neurotypical people, a few of which are shared in this video. This perpetuation that burnout only occurs in ways the neurotypical brain conceives makes it more difficult for neurodivergent people to identify when they are in a period of burnout- especially for those who are alexithymic. This also means that treatment for burnout as recommended for neurotypical burnout isn‚Äôt always successful in treating burnout for neurodivergent people. I‚Äôm glad that Big Think has made a video detailing burnout to help those experiencing it identify their condition, but I am dissatisfied with the lack of explanation and acceptance of different types of burnout.",0,2023-08-01T18:56:45Z

The very first individual 'treatment' is to see it as a workplace problem not a 'you' problem!! Because if your burnt out odds are your co-workers are suffering too, so reach out to your peers and support one another to get help! Your industry/job should have a 'occupational health and saftey rep' or first aid officer you can talk to about the problems, and can provide support and help to fixing them. If you don't have this check online to find out what laws apply in your country/state and reach out to a union (or form a group at work or with peers to help support you and fight for change). It is total nonsense to expect a person with burnout to 'go it alone' in quitting work or fighting a unsafe workplace, instead reach out, talk about your problems and make friends - because you are not alone, and together it's much easier to fight back or get treatment when you know your legal rights, have people to support you and use workers compensation or laws to 'fix' the problems.",0,2023-07-28T06:35:33Z

If you've ever experienced sleep paralysis, that's what burnout felt like to me. When I would sit down at my computer to start working, my arms felt paralyzed; it took all of my will to lift my hands to the keyboard to start working.

That was five years ago. Even today, the thought of putting together a resume and starting the interview process for another engineering job feels daunting and stress-inducing. Even worse, the experience was systemic; it left me unmotivated and apathetic toward all aspects of my life. It's a malaise that persists to this day.

I think it would be very useful if Human Resource Departments had concrete education and official frameworks (ie via recognised standards/certifications) to help them identify the symptoms of burnout,  so they can then work with psychologists to help workers suffering from this condition. It should be part of ESG reform. Your comment on the sabbatical to re-align oneself resonates :). Thankyou for this piece. Mental health management of the workforce is probably ''underweight'' in most boardroom agendas, yet it is so critical to long term performance of staff - arguably helping to reduce un-necessary ''churn' and is arguably a pre-requisite for creating a healthy work atmosphere which ultimately makes the workplace a more happy and productive environment., When humans are committed, they can create the magic via 'healthy and happy'' hard work that takes businesses to the next level. My suspicion is that many just quit, get fired or just get pushed aside when all they needed was correct diagnosis then treatment of sorts.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@Nylak-Otter,"Oh, yeah.  About 8 years ago I hit burnout in my profession, which is extremely emotionally demanding every day along with being physically demanding.  I hated my life, I hated my hopes and dreams, I hated everything I had ever loved.  I was acutely suicidal and finally ended up in the hospital with acute alcoholic hepatitis at 25 years old with 2 days to live.

So that got me off work for about 5 years, since I couldn't exist outside the hospital for a few days until about a year after finally receiving a liver transplant.  And boy howdy, try living with survivor's guilt after some specialists fought tooth and nail for you, even though you were a staggering, suicidal alcoholic.  ""But she's so young and works in an extremely valuable field!  We need to care for the caretakers!  She's intelligent and highly motivated, so she has a low chance of recidivism!  We can use her as a headlining example for our new study with alcoholics and longterm recovery!  Guilt guilt guilt!!""

I'm back to it, and the burnout came back within 6 months this time.  I don't lnow what to do.  I wish I hadn't survived.  But now I have a transplant that they didn't need to give me, and I need to do what I'm on this stupid rock to do, but it's impossible to make any lasting change.  I feel like I'm trying to empty the ocean with a thimble.

And, unfortunately, this burnout isn't just with my job; my job is *ME.*  It's all I am, and all I've wanted to do since I was about 5 years old.  I hate being me.

Nah. What I did instead is tell my boss he has overloaded me by quadrupling my workload over the years without providing resources.

I was mobbed in my previous job and I decided to move to another workplace closer to my home, hoping that things would finally get better. God I was wrong. I was feeling exausted and I thought all I needes was a vacation so I went to Prague with some friend and had good time. A week later I started the new job buy something was off: I was feeling out of context with no purpose, asking myself ""what the hell am I doing here? These guys are way better than me!"" and all this kind of stuff. The context in the office wasn't relaxed at all with that underlying sense of tension between collegues and the manager. So I started to get anxious and feel like I had fever, I was very hot all the time and sweating. I hated the job. It went for a couple of months until I lost the job for low productivity. And THANK GOD! When they told me It was my last day I felt like a massive burden on my shoulders was finally gone. I was HAPPY!

During the great depression, the governments provided opportunities for people to get food, but also to have a job so they could be paid, which in turn led to feeling better about their purpose in life.  Today, there are jobs, people could do them, but they choose the alternative routes.  Maybe this works, but I feel too many are choosing the easier routes without understanding the hidden, subtle, and long term consequences of their choices.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@Clint945,"As a fellow academic, i find it really very insulting that she said ""oh i just took a sabbatical to fix my issues"". Most people can't do that, and suggestions like that are utterly pointless. The burnout stems *from* an inability to stop working, an inability to control your circumstances, little to no reward for your work, and the apathy that comes with those things.

This speaker is a professor, head of department (i.e. has been heavily rewarded for their work), and was able to take a sabbatical (i.e. has complete control of their workflow) and they have the audacity to pretend that this is any sort of solution for the vast majority of people?

Further, while she does - very briefly - talk about organisations needing to change their approach to work, she spends most of her time talking about how *you* need to change *your* approach to work. Cause clearly, its the worker that's mostly at fault here. *You* haven't managed *your* workload effectively, *you* haven't taken time for *your* hobbies and interests, *you* identify too strongly with *your* work. Shifting blame and responsibility onto the worker and not the employer or the structural systems behind the work...

In the US, the best burnout treatment most people can hope for is a compassionate boss that will help prioritize your mental health by making small, temporary adjustments to your workload.  In the Netherlands, you're able to take up to two years off with a government mandated 70% minimum of your pay to allow you to focus on your mental health and truly treat your symptoms.  And many companies will even add additional pay up to 100% of your salary.  And yes, we do pay high taxes for the privilege of prioritizing mental health, other healthcare, transportation, education, etc - but in my mind - it's absolutely worth every penny to know that if and when I need help, I'm able to seek it - regardless of pre-existing conditions or financial pressures.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@TriAngles3D,"Here, where you are now, turns out to be something else than you had expected. And, not for the better...

Go back to the beginning. Ask yourself what was that that first inspired you. What gave you the energy to do what you do best. Go back to that. Rediscover that.

 In my view the biggest mistake you can make is going past your boundaries. Gradually at first and then systematically. Your mind is warning you. But you are not listening. 

Mind and body decouple. Without a sense of intrinsic boundaries you have lost a sense of yourself. You are lost. Everything else becomes too much.

You know what you feel you just don't now why you feel the way you do anymore. You can't pint point it. And, that only amplifies the ill condition.

Counseling, coaching, therapy? Yeah, that helps some. But not all. Short-term solution. A more sustainable solution is re-programming yourself.

The mind is probability calculation machine. You need to re-learn that what you do has high probability of a positive return. 

Find what first inspired you. Start very simple. Do it over and over again and build on that until your mind re-learns that you have a positive effect on yourself and environment.

In my case I fixed a cabinet door and ended up renovating my house. At each iteration my mind gets to take in a tangible result of my efforts. A positive and constructive feedback.  

Mind and body re-align. 

Very good information. Being able to clarify or otherwise validate what you are experiencing is the first step towards gaining some sense of relief and formulating a plan to recovery.",0,2023-07-03T11:20:46Z

Chronic conditions like C-PTSD including combat addiction or some other chronic maladies like asthma and allergies or an active chronic infection instead. Like after growing up in a home  Reading a book written by saint Theresa of Liseaux helped a lot of people in the U.S. who are veterans who had to work around burn pits while serving for a couple of years in the U.S. military after arriving back home needing to readjust when with a handicap which might not go into remission when being expected to live one day at a time like a hero while working to heal themselves from the psycholodgical trauma experiecned both when on the war front and while at home when being told that their problems are only all in their heads for awhile maybe only thanks to some medical insurance company conflict of interest reasons. Having to cope with a longer than 6 months in duration chronic illness too while having an active case of Tuiberculosis which is what that saint had to cope with at the time when there was no anti-biotic treatment for it wasn't at all easy for her to cope with too.,0,2023-07-01T19:44:52Z

VMbhM59K5FQ,@jimwilliams3816,"I would have liked a last piece about recovering from established long term burnout. This is the hardest, because the preventative measures probably still apply, but they take on the quality of more things you ‚Äúare supposed to be doing‚Äù ‚Äî more demands. My one criticism of the piece is that I think limiting burnout to work factors creates an incomplete picture. Personal demands can definitely play a role. Single moms is probably the most often cited, though in my case an elderly parent was the biggest factor.

The reason I got served this clip is that long term burnout is a big topic at the moment on the neurodivergent channels, ADHD and autism. Neurodivergence adds some tricky variables; it certainly can make you more vulnerable to burnout, and certain neurodivergent traits strongly resemble the symptoms of burnout, which makes untangling what is a result of what that much harder. Not least because some of the traits that resemble burnout may in fact come from experiencing the causes of burnout throughout all areas of a neurodivergent person‚Äôs life. These days, this type of ongoing stress is often misattributed as trauma, and I appreciate that this piece talks about stress as a root. I do feel a need to clarify one last thing about that, however: burnout as an outcome is distinguishable from stress, but it flows from persistent stress. If you are trying to preempt burnout, it‚Äôs very important not to fall into looking at your situation and going ‚Äúit‚Äôs just stress.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing ‚Äújust‚Äù about stress. No one can live a stress free life, just as no one can avoid being exposed to any carcinogens. But too much of either too constantly is likely to lead to health problems, and in the case of stress, those problems are often mental health related. Alas, the concerns often get applied only to whether you have a heart attack or a stroke. But many of us can tell you that breakdowns can be debilitating too. Persistent stress does damage to all systems, especially the prefrontal cortex. It is long past time for business and society to stop pretending that ‚Äúwhat does not kill us makes us stronger.‚Äù",21,2023-06-30T13:46:06Z

When I talk to others about burnout which I've gotten quite a bit (ask anyone in design or marketing) they usually talk about the exhaustion of not being able to care of yourself. For example, working on a project for so long that you haven't showered, haven't had time to do any hobbies, and missed family events and on Monday you still gotta go in and get more stuff on your plate. That's burntout there's  no other emotions other than anger, you're just angry you gotta work this hard to keep your job and make someone richer than you. That's the state I've found plenty of people in...I do agree with the rewards part, it adds to it. These signs/definitions sound more like depression then burnout..again burnout is the point where you can't sleep properly because your job/responsibilities are hunting you = you can't take care of yourself.

Our success is most often than not, not in our hands. We rely on others to elevate us to where we wanna go, and today hard work is not rewarded. So we become pissed off, cynical, depressed, nihilistic. 

For me? Its pissed off, because ive always stood everyone up regardless of lvl of experience or qualification without feeling like its hard in every working environment ive been in, and yet im tired of petty, insignificunts who wont move asside because their ego or delusions cant handle it. So i distance myself from society because people make me tired, i dont deal with slackers or anyone who cant keep up. I think allot of young people are tired of old methods, traditions, amd our fates decided by the older generations who dumped their problems onto us and then have the audacity to call us weak. Like yeah its my fault i cant afford a house when you could at my age. Russia, Japan even South Africa, and more, the youth are subject to decisions made by their older peers that hinder our lives. Hence we are all so fked in the head these days.",10,2023-06-25T14:21:27Z

Our lifestyles are so unnatural and nonstop. The large majority also deal with real financial stress just trying to survive and get to work and pay for childcare. 
Then there's all the greed and corruption that dictates and shapes important social structures like access to medicine and education.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@mmdrodrigues,"""clinical syndrome"" some MDD'S dont go diagnosed, good luck with diagnosing this ""light"" and fairly badly defined ""syndrome""

Burnout sounds very much like feeling depression or even initial stages of Major depressive disorder. What's different.... Can someone please explain this from a fact based, medical perspective. It seems like burnout would be the result one would get if one asked a modern day slightly or very woke person to come um with a syndrome.

VMbhM59K5FQ,@robertdouglas8895,"This burnout happens when you think the world is against you, as she says you think people have bad intentions against you and that you will suffer because of that. As  individuals, we can feel incompetent.But we are not individuals. We are created in the likeness of God and have God protecting  us. When we separate ourselves from God, we think that He has bad intentions against us, too. The guilt piles up. The solution is to forgive everyone for what they are not doing to you. We are all masters of our fate and joining with God gives us the right way to proceed with compassion.
