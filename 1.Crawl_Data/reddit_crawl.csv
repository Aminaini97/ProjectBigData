antiwork,I quit my toxic job and held my ground!,"Just wanted to share because I'm still buzzing from this. My old manager was a nightmare. Micromanaging everything, making snide comments about my work in front of others, and basically treating me like garbage for months.

Last week she pulled me into her office and started going off about some minor mistake. I just looked at her and said ""I'm done. This is my two weeks notice.""

She completely lost it. Started yelling about how I was being unprofessional and that I couldn't just quit like that. Tried guilt tripping me about leaving the team short staffed.

I stayed calm and told her my decision was final. She kept pushing, so I said ""Actually, make that effective immediately"" and walked out.

Been getting texts from coworkers saying she's been scrambling trying to figure out how to cover my workload. Apparently she's been staying late every day this week lol.",3061,70,1758423196.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1nmgwbk/i_quit_my_toxic_job_and_held_my_ground/
antiwork,Annual compliance training suggests that asserting work-life balance boundaries counts as harassment,"Was doing those lengthy compliance training courses that have become a yearly staple, this one was on harassment. They provide video scenarios and we have to identify what level of harassment they fall under. 

Video was shaved down a little bit to be able to upload to Imgur- in the scenario, employee already had an agreement with the company to leave at 5pm on that day of the week, every week, but the manager was asking her to stay late for a project. The apparent “correct answer” as to what level of harassment this was, was “yellow” (moderate). The training’s justification was :

“The employee is critical of the manager for prioritizing work over a personal life.
The employee was emotionally reactive when delivering that message and did not hesitate to negatively judge and disrespect her manager.”

Idk about yall but I don’t see disrespect, emotional reaction, or negative judgement; I saw an employee reasserting her already agreed-upon boundaries and holding her boss accountable to them. ",1473,56,1759570662.0,https://imgur.com/a/2Jaqjug

work,People with kids do less work than the rest of us,"I am noticing more and more that people tend to use having children as an excuse to regularly not be able to do things or be available at times that fall within their specified working day.

The amount of times I’ve heard from people ‘I can’t do a call at 9am, I’m dropping the kids off’ etc. Yet their working day is 8.30-5pm? There’s also appointments, phone calls…the list of kid related things that people just do instead of their actual job.

I completely understand sometimes people will need to take time out due to children, and I actually support flexible working. But I feel that more and more people just use it as an excuse and actually spend more time doing things for their kids than actually working. Yet all the people with no kids are constantly available and working much harder than those that do.

I find it frustrating but there isn’t anything you can say as people with children cannot compute that they still need to work and be available just as much as the rest of us.",3057,2376,1758661640.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1notgdl/people_with_kids_do_less_work_than_the_rest_of_us/

work,I think I have the most toxic job,"I work 6 days a week and there are no designated work hours. Some days you’ll have to wake up and go to work at 6am, some days you’ll have to wait till 9pm to meet a customer. Welcome to the sales side of medical device industry where salesperson are slaves to surgeons and have to suck up to their ego just to hit their unimaginably high target. 

The thing is, the work never stops. There are constant texts and calls even on Sundays. I got a call at 9PM on a Sunday from a team member asking about my availability because I wasn’t responding on text. Well, duh? I was out having dinner and catching up with a friend and didn’t look at my phone. I can’t be available 24/7 man. 

I’m so exhausted by how this industry works. Sure there are good days when the incentive money comes in but that’s about it. Every single person I’ve seen who works here does not have a life beyond work and that REALLY sucks. 

People ask me to make boundaries and while I try to do that sometimes it’s just impossible because the nature of the work is such that you can’t be not available. 

I’m tired and desperate to switch my industry, I’m only worried no one else would hire me because of the niche I’m in. ",11,3,1757269094.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1nb0jt7/i_think_i_have_the_most_toxic_job/

careerguidance,"I'm 27 with no job experience and college degree and no skills, how do I restart?","Yes I'm 27 with no job experience, skills and degree. I'm just living my life in isolation because I think I'm carrying shame guilt fear anxiety and constantly worrying about my life. I just never had a perfect path in life. Because when I was in high school, my family had a stroke so I became caretaker and within few yrs they passed away. I did go school to get GED diploma and enrolled in community college. I even tried working few jobs in fast food because is only thing I could find but I didn't work for too long as extended family relatives kept on judging me saying your very behind in life based on your age plus your not driving which is limiting your opportunities to going college and finding better jobs. The city transportation sucked in my area as there is no buses available. So then I did few classes online for some healthcare program but it didn't go well as the advisor said it's highly competitive. So I felt discouraged and even failed 1 class so I just gave up. Then I worked at retail store night shift but I got fired because of covid absences. I felt extremely scared like what am I gonna say during a next interview if they mention something.

I'm so overwhelmed and hopeless because I have no good track record for jobs. I also don't have any skills and college degree. I'm tired of living in isolation and relying on others. I have lost all the enthusiasm from life. Don't like to buy things or work on myself because it requires money. I don't want to be burden. My parents also passed away recently. Only my older sibling works and I'm feeling extremely bad for sitting in misery. I got suggestions to learn driving fast and just find a nearby job in anything to earn money and slowly figure out what career path or short term certifications maybe i.t. or healthcare or something.",149,50,1759610289.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ny4u6d/im_27_with_no_job_experience_and_college_degree/
careerguidance,What should I do for the rest of my life?,"Guys. I’m 31 and I feel like I completely wasted my degree and my 20s. I have a bachelor’s in international business with a dual minor in Chinese language and Chinese studies. I don’t use it at all anymore.

Instead, I’m stuck at a tech company making $55k a year, doing the most mundane, soul-crushing work imaginable. It’s not challenging, it’s not fulfilling, and honestly it makes me feel like I’m rotting away.

On top of that, $55k doesn’t go far in this economy. I can’t afford a house, I can barely save, and I feel like I’m falling further behind every year. I want to make a career move but I feel paralyzed — like I missed the window in my 20s to build something meaningful and now I’m just stuck grinding away for scraps.

Not to mention it seems like all my friends have 6 figure jobs with multiple houses and I’m just living in the shadows

careerguidance,"I don't want 9-5 life for the rest of my life - I just want to live in nature and explore the world and connect with people and cultures and create, contribute on hands on projects, with people. I am not sure what it looks like exactly yet - how can I do / plan for this?","Has anyone done this? How do I make a exit plan or plan for this...

But I just realized all this corporate ladder is pointless. Dream job is pointless. there is no dream in job that doesn't give u any flexibility   
  
I just finished  doing graphic design internship and looking for new job. but to be honest its filling my with fear, anxiety and terror.   
  
The fear of no job, losing job, no time and energy to do what I want, then dying with regrets. and even the fear of having a job and doing 9-5 forever . and fear of not having money too.. 

But I need more money so I can retire or have savings/ investments to generate passive income. Why is this so hard. But I don't have a high paying job T-T. I find it unethical to sell for the sake of it just to make money and hard. It just feels so wrong.

how did you make a living though? I dont think my asian family will let me... and I won't have a home to come back to.

But im really depr\*ssed tbh... design in corporate is not what I expected.

I just finished graphic design degree and I want to work abroad, travel full time, meet new people connect, explore different cultures, have wonderful friends and relationships and create with people, in business, art, etc. and most importantly be in nature like beach, countryside a lot of the time... and beautiful scenery... not a 9-5 in city... or corporate. Im not exactly sure what its like but not sitting with screens all day, exhausted, pain, tired, and then craving nature all the time.. and having health issues... that I also need money to resolve with...

I see a lot of ppl just living in their van or backpacking etc, or going off grid or growing their own food in farm, etc..

Right now Im looking for new job in design, **but it fills me with dread and anxiety thinking about it... I can't imagine this being my life and career to stick to for the rest of my life until I die. How do you even decide this is what you want to stick with until u die? like** I **have other** interests **but the time and money commitment for another degree scares me and maybe ill end up not wanting to do that industry/ career too..**

but I feel like maybe I have to if I want to have retirement... Also I dont have visa to work or live in Europe or US ... I am scared I will starve when im old and need to retire... Your medical degree and background and savings probably allow you to have a safety net or money and job to fall back into though right...

do you have any advice for those that just graduated and no money/ income or much skills...

productivity,Finding it IMPOSSIBLE to work from home,"Hello. I've been REALLY struggling getting any work done ever since I've switched from working at libraries, universities, and coffee shops - to working from home. I'm an animator, and the main reason I'm switching to working at home is because I upgraded from laptop to PC for my animation work (PC is faster + more efficient).

There are SO many distractions at home. Today, for instance - I literally spent about 5 hours ""taking care"" of my bonsai tree during the time I should have spent working. Yesterday, I walked my dog for a couple hours while I should've been working. Other days, I'll waste time doing things like watching tv/videos, cleaning, or just laying on my bed doing nothing but scrolling on my phone. Since my ""office"" is in my room, it's easy for me to tell myself I'll take only a 5 minute break on my phone lying in bed - only for that 5 minutes to turn into hours of wasted time.

Working at home causes me to take my sweet time with EVERYTHING! Making/eating breakfast, walking my dog, simply getting up in the morning, etc. I feel no sense or urgency or pressure to get things done quickly - probably because I'm already in my comfortable home. It's incredibly hard for me to even wake up on time and start working at the designated time I tell myself (8am-4pm). I also feel less energy ever since I stopped going out of the house to work. Another thing that bugs me is how isolating/lonely working from home can feel. I also should mention I have ADHD, which only amplifies all of these problems.

I need serious help guys - before this starts affecting my career!! Any advice you have is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",42,33,1758231556.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1nkl7u2/finding_it_impossible_to_work_from_home/

I lost my job about six months ago. It was actually a good thing; I started feeling burn-out, stress, overwhelm, and the like.
