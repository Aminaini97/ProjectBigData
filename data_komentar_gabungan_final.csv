heres a few things aside from the money that has kept me in the corporate world that might hopefully help some other folks that are struggling or looking for new opportunities ive always worked within minutes of my home this allows me to go home on lunch every single day i have also sacrificed money promotions and opportunity in order to have and maintain this luxury i do not i repeat i do not take my work home and i very rarely get in early or leave late its about setting boundaries if i cant get my work done in a solid hours or hours or whatever the company is understaffed and that isnt my problem period now there are certain times that i need to work extra but that is up to me to manage and not the company to decide i try to save and invest as much money as i can afford to and live as debt free as possible this is in my opinion the biggest reason people get trapped lifestyle inflation it only costs kk per year to live in the majority of america anything above that is not a necessity i live like i make poverty wages so that the company will never own me create a budget then stick to it always have something to look forward to outside of work it might only be one night that week but that excitement build up keeps me in the game its like a reward i worked hard all week so now i get to go out and hang with friends or play golf or whatever never let your job become your identity hope that helps some folks on their journey to finding peace in this crazy world get in take whats yours and move along if you dont someone else will its a harsh reality out there but its possible to survive in it,,YouTube
the bottom line is that money and greed come before anything in business otherwise there would be no business the idea that dialogue with understanding and exploring alternative options or whatever corporate measures are in place to help an employees personal growth is simply untrue those tools are put forth by safety hands or managers to ensure that the company investment pays off to their own benefitboth the company as well as the manager mental health and well being will always be the last thing on a companys mind as long as theyre prosperous sad but true money talks,,YouTube

merit qualifications and need employees who feel that positions or scholarships are predetermined based on personal relationships rather than abilities or qualifications may feel discouraged and disengaged knowing that their efforts will not be recognized or rewarded fairly excluding deserving candidates when deserving staff members are excluded from job or scholarship opportunities because

hard work and contributions are undervalued or ignored this can foster resentment and may cause talented staff members to leave the organization resulting in lost potential and reduced productivity nepotism and corruption offering scholarships or job opportunities to the children or relatives of leadership while denying the same opportunities to other deserving staff members constitutes nepotism this corrupt practice not only damages trust within the organization but also breeds a culture of favoritism where employees are more likely to feel that their chances of success are dependent on personal connections rather than their qualifications nepotism can also create an environment where employees are more focused on aligning with those in power rather than working towards organizational goals stunting creativity and innovation disruption of meritocracy a workplace built on meritocracy ensures that individuals are rewarded and recognized for their skills qualifications and achievements when job positions and scholarships are allocated based on favoritism or nepotism it disrupts the meritbased system this results in an unfair workplace where promotions and opportunities are no longer based on merit but on personal relationships or connections employees who see this happening may feel demoralized and less motivated to perform at their best which negatively impacts the overall productivity and success of the organization creating unhealthy competition when leadership prioritizes personal interests over merit it creates a competitive environment that is not based on healthy competition employees may feel pressured to align themselves with leadership rather than focusing on improving their skills or contributing to the organization

dictate the allocation of job positions and scholarships undermines the integrity of the organization if such practices become known they can damage the organizations reputation both internally and externally employees prospective job candidates and other stakeholders may lose trust in the organizations ability to uphold fairness and integrity making it more difficult to attract and retain talent impact on employee motivation and engagement employees who perceive that job opportunities and scholarships are granted based on favoritism are less likely to be motivated and engaged in their work when people feel that their efforts are ignored or that they have no real chance of advancement due to personal connections they may become disengaged this can result in reduced performance a lack of initiative and ultimately a negative impact on the organizations overall success addressing these issues implement fair and transparent selection processes employers should establish clear fair and transparent policies for job recruitment and scholarship allocation selection criteria should be based on merit qualifications and performance rather than personal relationships these policies should be communicated to all staff ensuring that everyone understands how decisions are made and that no individual is given preferential treatment promote equal opportunity all employees should be given equal opportunity to apply for job positions and scholarships regardless of their relationship with leadership decisions should be made based on qualifications performance and need leadership should ensure that every employee has access to the same resources and opportunities to advance within the organization ensure accountability leaders and managers should be held accountable for ensuring that recruitment and scholarship processes are fair and transparent if nepotism or favoritism is discovered those responsible should face consequences holding leadership accountable for their actions helps to foster trust in the organization and reinforces the importance of fairness and integrity encourage meritbased recognition employers should encourage a meritbased culture where employees are recognized and rewarded for their skills achievements and contributions this includes ensuring that promotions job opportunities and scholarships are given based on performance not personal relationships a meritbased approach helps to motivate employees to perform at their best and fosters a positive and productive work environment create clear channels for reporting unfair practices employees should have access to mechanisms for reporting unfair practices such as nepotism or favoritism without fear of retaliation these channels should be confidential and complaints should be thoroughly investigated by addressing complaints in a timely and fair manner organizations can ensure that their workplace remains equitable and just in conclusion favoritism and nepotism in the allocation of job positions and scholarships are clear examples of corruption that undermine fairness and equity in the workplace by promoting transparency accountability and meritbased decisionmaking employers can create a work environment where all employees have an equal chance to succeed ultimately leading to greater productivity morale and organizational success,,YouTube

using office canteens to create an illusion of superiority and a class system based on who can afford special menus as well as using the office eatery as a tool for social exclusion is a deeply problematic practice that can significantly impact the work environment and employees wellbeing below are some ways in which this can manifest creating a class divide if office canteens offer different menus or food options based on an employees position salary or status it can lead to the creation of a visible class divide for example if highlevel staff members have access to gourmet

further deepen the divide between different groups within the workplace employees may feel less included in informal networking opportunities or teambuilding moments especially if meals or social interactions in the office canteen are important for building relationships and creating a sense of community such exclusion can diminish morale and create cliques which can erode teamwork and trust undermining team collaboration a canteen that is used to segregate employees based on their financial means or job titles can hinder the development of a collaborative work culture if employees from different levels are unable to interact casually over meals due to imposed divisions it can reduce the flow of communication and ideas across the organization this separation can prevent lowerlevel staff from engaging with higherups or sharing valuable insights which can ultimately harm the organizations overall performance and innovation psychological impact constantly being reminded of ones social or economic position within the organization can take a psychological toll on employees when food choices or access to certain areas become markers of status it can negatively affect selfesteem job satisfaction and general wellbeing employees may feel less motivated to work in an environment where they feel judged based on their salary or rank leading to decreased morale and engagement unfair power dynamics by using the office canteen as a platform for social exclusion employers or staff with more influence may reinforce unhealthy power dynamics this can perpetuate favoritism and control where certain groups have the upper hand in dictating who can access what based on arbitrary social distinctions this can ultimately lead to toxic workplace dynamics where power is used to create divisions rather than foster an inclusive and supportive environment undermining inclusivity one of the fundamental values many organizations strive for is inclusivity using the office canteen to create an exclusive atmosphere where certain employees are privileged over others directly contradicts this goal a workplace culture that promotes inclusivity ensures that all employees feel valued and respected regardless of their role or pay when office spaces such as canteens are used to undermine this it damages the organizations ability to attract and retain talent especially those who may feel marginalized or excluded to address these issues employers should consider the following strategies promote equal access office canteens should offer equal access to all employees ensuring that no one feels excluded based on their salary position or social status offering a range of affordable meal options that everyone can enjoy regardless of their financial situation is key to promoting inclusivity foster social inclusion canteens can be used as spaces for employees of all levels to come together interact and collaborate informally employers should encourage a culture where employees are free to sit and eat together regardless of their roles fostering a sense of community and breaking down hierarchical barriers ensure transparency it is important for employers to ensure that any special menu options or offers in the canteen are communicated transparently and that employees feel they have equal opportunity to access them if there are special offers or menus for specific groups these should be handled in a way that avoids reinforcing divisions or creating feelings of exclusion encourage a supportive environment employers can use the office canteen as a place to build team spirit and foster support among employees events such as team lunches casual meetups or employee appreciation days can be organized to ensure everyone feels welcome and appreciated regardless of their rank or salary lead by example managers and higherlevel employees should lead by example making a point to sit and interact with staff from all levels during lunch or other canteen events this demonstrates that social or professional status does not determine who can share a meal which can help break down hierarchical divisions and promote equality in conclusion using the office canteen to create a class system or engage in social exclusion is detrimental to both the workplace culture and employees sense of wellbeing employers should ensure that their office spaces including canteens foster inclusivity transparency and equal opportunity for all employees regardless of their position or pay by doing so they can cultivate a more positive supportive and productive work environment,,YouTube
when employers and staff use office functions such as family fun days seminars workshops conferences meetings themeunit retreats and other workplace activities as platforms for exclusionary tactics and favoritism it undermines the purpose of these events and damages the organizational culture these events ideally meant to foster unity skill development and collaboration can be manipulated to perpetuate inequality favoritism and exclusion which can erode morale and trust within the team below are some key ways in which such practices manifest exclusionary tactics instead of promoting inclusivity some employers and staff may selectively invite certain individuals to office functions based on personal preferences status or relationships this could lead to employees feeling left out particularly those who might not be part of a specific social group or favored by management this selective participation undermines the goal of fostering a sense of belonging and collaboration among all staff members favoritism in recognition and opportunity during seminars workshops or teambuilding activities some employees may receive disproportionate recognition rewards or opportunities based on favoritism rather than merit this could include preferential treatment in promotions salary increases or opportunities to attend highprofile conferences or training sessions such practices can demotivate other employees especially those who feel their achievements are overlooked in favor of those with personal connections to management or colleagues undermining meritbased systems ideally workplace activities like workshops or seminars should be designed to recognize employees hard work achievements and professional growth when favoritism takes precedence over merit it sends a message that individual effort and accomplishment are not valued as much as personal relationships or loyalty this can lead to resentment among staff and a breakdown in trust between employees and management manipulating workplace events for personal gain some employers or staff members may use office functions as a way to advance personal agendas form alliances or reinforce power dynamics within the workplace for example management may organize an extravagant retreat or seminar to strengthen their ties with favored employees while neglecting the broader team this manipulation not only wastes organizational resources but also creates a toxic work environment where individuals feel their value is tied to personal relationships rather than professional abilities exploiting vulnerabilities for control in some cases office functions are used to create a sense of loyalty by exploiting vulnerabilities such as giving certain staff members preferential treatment in return for their obedience or loyalty this type of behavior fosters dependency and compliance rather than encouraging independent thinking and teamwork it reduces individuals to pawns in a power play creating a highly unequal and toxic work atmosphere disregard for employee rights when employers prioritize personal relationships over a rightsbased approach they may overlook employees legal rights or fail to provide a fair and transparent process for promotions training or other workplace opportunities employees who are not part of the favored group may find themselves repeatedly passed over for opportunities and facing challenges in accessing resources that are rightfully theirs the negative consequences of these practices include decreased morale and productivity employees who feel excluded or unfairly treated are likely to become demotivated which can lead to reduced engagement and productivity this can have a direct impact on the overall performance and success of the organization loss of trust favoritism and exclusionary tactics erode trust between employees and management leading to a lack of transparency and accountability within the organization once trust is lost it is difficult to rebuild and the workplace becomes less collaborative and more divided increased turnover employees who feel that their work and contributions are undervalued or ignored in favor of others may choose to leave the organization high turnover rates can disrupt operations and increase recruitment and training costs toxic work environment when favoritism is prevalent it can lead to unhealthy competition gossip and rivalry among employees further exacerbating divisions within the team a toxic work environment makes it difficult for employees to work together harmoniously leading to decreased morale poor performance and potentially even legal challenges to mitigate these issues employers should focus on the following strategies promote inclusivity office functions should be designed to encourage participation from all employees regardless of their background or relationships with management creating an environment where everyone feels valued and included is key to fostering a positive and collaborative workplace culture recognize achievements based on merit employers should ensure that promotions rewards and opportunities are given based on the achievements skills and contributions of employees rather than personal relationships a clear and transparent system for recognizing employees efforts ensures fairness and motivates staff to continue performing at their best ensure equal access to opportunities all employees should have equal access to workplace functions training opportunities and career development programs favoring a select group undermines the professional growth of others and leads to a sense of injustice by creating equitable systems for access employees will feel that their contributions are recognized and valued adopt a rightsbased approach rather than using office functions to create loyalty through favoritism employers should adhere to a rightsbased approach focusing on treating all employees fairly and upholding their legal rights transparency in decisionmaking processes helps prevent the exploitation of employees and fosters a more just and supportive workplace encourage open communication employees should feel comfortable speaking up about unfair practices or exclusionary behavior without fear of retaliation a culture of open communication where employees are encouraged to provide feedback and raise concerns is crucial to maintaining a healthy transparent workplace in conclusion using office functions as platforms for exclusionary tactics and favoritism not only undermines the purpose of these events but also creates a toxic and unequal work environment employers should strive to implement meritbased recognition inclusivity and fairness ensuring that all employees have equal access to opportunities and are treated with respect by doing so organizations can foster a positive motivated and productive workforce,,YouTube

the theory i believe regarding work leave is a societyindividual interaction theory if we look through the maslow lense for a moment we have our fundamental needs which up until recently hadnt been met and still isnt for everyone yet what we see is higher sick leave in countries that are the healthiest and richest when our biological needs arent met we have a deeply primal kind of motivation for work which drives us even when feeling bad sick or just tired we dont really have an option as we are dependent on the work to pay just our next meal in more developed countries all those needs are met we have social security money on a backup account payed our bills in advance and the biologicalsurvival part of motivation is almost completely disengaged as its developed to respond to short term dangers not abstract long term ones the richer and more developed parts of the world are hitting a wall where the selfactualization part is our next goal and the workplace simply isnt made for it there is limited selfactualization potential in a factory job or a call center an so on we know we arent there to survive anymore and so there is limited motivation and it feels subjectivly pointless it doesnt progress us as individuals it doesnt promote our full potential and it simply isnt alligned with our goals and aspirations there is a disconnect between the work needed to maintain a high living standard and what that living standard causes us to strive for,,YouTube

corrupt practices in budget planning such as inflating costs and staff remuneration undermine the financial integrity of an organization and create significant ethical issues these practices not only damage the companys financial health but also harm employees stakeholders and the overall workplace culture corrupt practices in budget planning can include inflating staff remuneration one common way employers manipulate budgets is by inflating staff remuneration either by overreporting salaries or including fictitious positions this may be done for personal gain or to cover up misappropriation of funds senior executives or managers might artificially inflate their own salaries or bonuses sometimes at the expense of others this creates inequality within the workforce and misrepresents the companys financial health falsifying operational costs employers may inflate operational costs such as overhead supply costs or maintenance to create room for embezzlement or hide inefficiencies for example a company might report higherthannecessary expenses for office supplies equipment or services allowing managers or executives to divert money into their own pockets misuse of budget allocations sometimes budget items are intentionally misallocated funds meant for essential functions such as staff training or equipment upgrades may be diverted toward personal expenses or luxury items for senior management when critical resources are misallocated it can hinder the companys growth and employee welfare inflating cost estimates employers may inflate cost estimates for projects purchases or services giving them more financial leeway this allows them to divert the excess funds elsewhere often for personal enrichment this practice is particularly damaging when it affects key areas like healthcare safety or employee benefits manipulating profit projections some employers manipulate profit projections to appear more successful than they are this is done to justify higher salaries bonuses or other perks for senior executives even when the company is financially struggling by reporting inflated earnings they can secure larger compensation packages consequences of corrupt budget planning include financial mismanagement inflating staff remuneration and operational costs leads to poor financial management which can have longterm consequences for a companys bottom line misallocating resources can drain reserves hinder growth and lead to job cuts or scaling down operations if not addressed it may lead to the companys collapse loss of employee trust and morale employees who become aware of or suspect financial manipulation may feel demoralized exploited and undervalued if they know funds are being misused they may lose confidence in their employer resulting in decreased productivity higher turnover and difficulty attracting talent inequality and unfair pay distribution when remuneration is inflated for certain employees especially senior management it creates a sense of injustice among the workforce lowerranking employees may feel their contributions are undervalued leading to resentment and a toxic work environment legal and reputational risks engaging in corrupt budget practices can lead to legal penalties such as fines lawsuits and loss of business licenses additionally the companys reputation can be severely damaged making it harder to attract new clients partners or employees ethical breakdown corruption in budget planning signifies broader ethical issues within the organization when leadership prioritizes personal gain over employee wellbeing the companys culture becomes toxic a lack of ethical behavior and transparency leads to a breakdown in organizational integrity to prevent and address corrupt budget practices employers should implement transparent budgeting processes adopt transparent budgeting procedures that are reviewed and verified by multiple stakeholders this reduces the opportunity for manipulation regular audits and monitoring conduct regular internal and external audits to detect discrepancies in financial records monitoring staff remuneration and operational costs can help identify fraud or misconduct early ethical training and leadership provide training on ethical budgeting and financial practices this helps employees at all levels understand the importance of integrity in financial matters whistleblower protections encourage employees to report corrupt practices without fear of retaliation strong whistleblower protections and anonymous reporting channels can help expose unethical behavior corporate governance and accountability establish strong governance structures with clear lines of accountability for financial decisions this ensures that individuals cannot manipulate the system for personal gain in conclusion corrupt practices in budget planning such as inflating costs and remuneration pose significant risks to organizations to ensure fairness financial health and trust employers must adopt transparent accountable and ethical budgeting practices,,YouTube

i love so many of your episodes but i would like to give one feedback to you and your team i think you in general are not very transparent about how your guests earn money and in what way this make stem invested in portraying a certain narrative we understand the world in stories and even though this guest is probably well intending its important to give the audience the ability to comprehend the full picture that also includes the fact that she is heavily incentivized to create fright over narsisists to attract people to her channel and keep them engaged she points out how they cant know for sure how many are narcissistic and tells us about peer reviewed articles pointing to about and then goes on to suggest which is absolutely shocking to have a scientist make up that number without any backing this wouldnt have been a problem if it wasten for the fact that our minds a biased towards these simple hooks and what we all probably have stuck in our head now is who in our friendsgroup i think its irresponsible at best dangerous at worst because it could just as well be that she just comes across far more people involved with narcissistic people due to her work then the rest of us do,,YouTube

the gospel of the word of almighty god the last age in which god is saving man from the imminent destruction of this old world at the time jesus worked in judea he worked openly but now i work and speak to you in secret my work among you is closed to others these words these chastisements and judgments is revealed only to you and not to others these people will soon become perfect after enduring the chastisements but those outside do not know about it this work is too hidden for them the incarnation is hidden man of god but to those in this flow he can be considered not a secret the work that is currently being carried out in you and in china is tightly closed so that they do not know if they do find out only judgment and persecution what they will do here they will not believe it to make the country a great red dragon the most backward of places is not an easy task if this work is carried out openly how will they allow it to advance can they bear the does god exist so my work cannot be seen known or discovered by unbelievers so working stealthily in this way benefits both you and the business as a whole everyone will know that there is a group of winners in china everyone will know that god incarnate is in china and that his work has come to an end it appears that god is personally doing his work in china and has perfected a group of people as overcomers almighty god said at the time jesus worked in judea he worked openly but now i work and speak to you in secret unbelievers are completely unaware of this my work with you is closed to others these words these punishments and judgments are revealed only to you and not to others all this work is performed on you and revealed only to you none of the nonbelieves know this because the time has not yet come these people are about to become perfect after enduring the punishments but those outside do not know about it this work is too hidden for them the incarnation of god is hidden but to those in this flow he can be considered not secret although everything is open to god everything is revealed and everything is revealed this is only true for those who believe in him and nothing is revealed to those who do not believe the work that is going on with you and in china is tightly closed so that they dont know if they knew about it they would only judge and persecute it they wont believe it to make the country of the great red dragon the most backward of places is not an easy thing to do if this work is revealed it will be impossible to continue this phase of the work simply cannot be performed in this area if this work were to be carried out openly how would they allow it to go forward wouldnt this bring even greater risk to the work if this work had not been hidden and instead had been carried out like in the time of jesus when he miraculously healed the sick and cast out demons wouldnt it have been locked up by the demons for a long time can they tolerate the existence of god if i were to enter the synagogues now to preach and give a sermon to people wouldnt i have been crushed long ago and if that happens how can my work continue to be carried out the reason why signs and wonders are not revealed openly is to cover up so my work cannot be seen known or discovered by unbelievers if this phase of work were to be done in the same way as jesus in the age of grace it would not be as strong as it is today so working stealthily in this way benefits both you and the business as a whole when gods work on earth come to the end that is when this secret work is finished this phase of work will be revealed everyone knows there is a group of winners in china everyone will know that god incarnated is in china and his work has come to completion only then will it be clear to people why has china not yet shown a decline or collapse it appears that god is personally doing his work in china and has perfected a group of people as overcomers from the mystery of the incarnation fulfillment of when i looked up someone handed me a book wrapped in a scroll i opened it and i read on both sides the prayers sorrows and curses ezekiel his garment was stained with blood he was called the word of god rev the kingdom he brought down and set up in the highest in the sky so that it can occupy his creation in the universe and engrave on it the entirety of his holy name the church of almighty god fulfillment of mat and i say as for you you are peter on top of this rock i will build my church that even the power of death will not be able to overcome it and the letter to the church in philadelphia rev and fulfillment of the new jerusalem the spirit enveloped me and the angel led me to the top of a very high mountain he showed me jerusalem the holy city coming down from heaven from god rev for the time has come in the house of god for the beginning of judgment in the house of god peter it is fulfilled that god himself is our pastor in rev for the lamb in the midst of the throne will be their pastor he will lead them to springs of lifegiving water and god will wipe away the tears from their eyes calling and leading the sheep of god to his glorious throne the church of almighty god to submit again to his authority so that he will continue to teach guide and protect even in plague famine and wild animals will not be moved by it and completely win this final battle with the big red dragon they say with a loud voice salvation comes from the lamb and from our god who sits on the throne rev and it will be fulfilled that will be established above the

of course stress is at the highest rate ever along with all the mental health issues this guest listed the biggest reason is because of our high rate of use of antidepressant drugs i will take bets that this doctor just as the random endocrinologist i called out of the blue decades ago is completely unaware that one single dose of prozac given to someone who had never taken the drug before experienced an increase of double the level of cortisol stress as a result i had called the endocrinologist to ask how long the human body can handle having their level of cortisol level doubled on a daily basis his reply was whoa you cannot do that to someone i persisted with if you could double cortisol daily how long can the human body tolerate that strong an impact on cortisol levels he replied a month maybe two three at the most why are you asking me this so i explained that is what medical research by the drug manufacturer shows is the result of one single mg dose of prozac because prozac has so many clones i would expect the same from them as they all inhibit the metabolism of serotonin his response was to basically quote his drug rep no no no prozac is a wonderful drug so i told him i would send him the link to the manufacturers own study so he could see for himself the reason he had no idea even as an endocrinologist who should know before anyone else was because if a drug company did that research outside of the us they did not have to report the results of that study to health professionals in the us so eli lilly did this most critical study in italy therefore did not have to report it to medical professionals who needed it this is why us doctors are completely unaware of this study unless they have seen it on the cover of my book prozac panacea or pandora but this is how medical experts are kept in the dark on such critical information on these ssri antidepressants the information on the amygdala gland connection to the fight or flight response helps me to better understand why i was drawn to the study of the essential aromatherapy oils to counter the adverse effects of so many of these so called antidepressant drugs which are in reality dissociative anesthetics instead fits perfectly the aromatherapy oils target the amygdala gland,"of course stress is at the highst rate ever along with all the mental health issues this guest listed the biggest reason is because the high rate of use of use of the antidepressant drugs I will take betting that this doctor just as the random endocrinologist Completely Unawae that one single dose of Prozac gives to someone who never takes the drug before experienced an increase of double the level of cortisol stress as a result I had called the endocrinologist to ask ask how long long Base His Reply Was Youa You Cannot Do That To Someone I Persistened With If You Could Cortisol Daily How Long Can The Human Body Tolerate That Strong An impact on Cortisol Levels He replied a Month Maybe two Three at the most why Medical Research by the drug manufacturer showing is the result of one single mg dose of prozac because prozac has so many clones I would expect the same from them as they all inhibit the metabolism of serotonin his response was to basically quote his drug. Toll Him I would send Him the link to the manufacturers own study so he could see for Himself the reason he had no idea even as an endocrinologist who should know know before Anyone Else was because IF a Drug Company Did that research outside of the us did not have to report the results of that Study to Health Professionals in the Us So Eli Lilly Did this most critical study in italy therefor did not have to report it to medical professionals who need it, this is why us the doctor is completely unawaely of this study unless This is how medical experts are kept in the dark on such critical information on these SSRI antidepressants the information on the amygdala gland connection to the fight or flight response helps me to better understand why I was drawn to the study of the essential aromatherapy oils to the advertise Effects of so many of these so called antidepressant drugs which are in reality dissociative anesthetics instal fits perfectly the aromatherapy oils target the amygdala gland",YouTube

off topic but i heard a scary phrase felt like sharing some related facts the roaring s was calculated by the real ruling uberwealthy elite to loan out money for people to start buisenisses buying anything expensive at mega low interest rates when their plan was to later create the great dustbowl depression ish years later when they knew all those loans can be instantly called in under the privately owned federal resrrve central bsnk of america started by nsthan rothschild in ish that fsmily still own of the builderburgs fed res now their standard loans national emergency clause saw people who took advantage of the ridiculously low interest rates who bought big expanding buisenisses mansions etc took further loans out to expand but suddenly had nothing were jumping out of their buildings top floors as they their families suddenly had negative equity had their buisenisses siezed by the loaning fed reserve had to starve or cue up for free gruel where if where it was availsable by charity but a large age starved to death the depression the roaring s was a tenish yrlong single timed nefarious plan to make the very rich who planned the scam even wealthier than ever in the roaring s everyone was told weve never had it so good any national emergency was seen told to be a virtual impossibility for the distsnt future a lie both were pre scheduled for the roaring s to culminate in the ish instant payback clause we were told at school that farmers for some weird reason not explained after generations of farming that stayed in the family had suddenly forgot or couldnt be bothered about crop rotatation caused all the topsoil to be blown away hence become a dustbowl depressions where crops couldnt grow animals couldnt graze trouble was it was all balls farmers were payed above the normal rates to destroy their crops the predident had to announce on radio why a citys people saw thousands of pigs burnt destroyed he announced it as honourable agreement because of international stock amounts trade agreements with other countries when folk were starving to death it was all calculated worked as planned the gold standard was then introduced under woodrow wilson who was bankrolled by the rothdchilds for his successful presidential campaign his required payback was to introduce the gold stsndard which he passed the bill unchallenged on an xmas eve where most folk didnt turn up to vote as they knew would happen so possible oponents to it were not informed or present to vote against it then hoarding gold beyond immediately wareable jewelry was encouraged by the media of the day to seem as being traitors to america if you didnt swap it for paper representation the federal reserve anounced or years ago how they have not had any gold to bsck the dollar since the s they pocketed the lot so all those films where fort knox was getting robbed or failed in trying to be robbed was based on misinformation fort knox had nothing inside maybe painted lead to be seen as backng the paper dollars folk swapped for gold which to me means they had it all for themselves the roaring any years is always part of a nefarious scheme to eff us over upto yrs later similar thing happened when thatcher promoted the fact we are a nation of house owners when mortgages were to interest at max but they knew that years later the interest rates will be manipulated to rise to or saw house reclaimed every minutes throughout great yeah sure britsin as for tried to take extra jobs or pay the very high addidition of that extra interest rate interest must all be payed before your money actually goes to buying the bricks mortar in any mortgage so their plan worked saw another massive wealth transfer to the already very wealthy dont trust roaring yesrs its part of a bigger plan to rip you off or eff you over in some way,Off Topic But I Heard a Scary Phrase Felt Like Sharing Some Related Facts The Roaring S was calculated by the Real Ruling

i am very interested in mental health because i have issues myself i started listening to this video because this subject matters to me and it is well done dont get me wrong but im now a little frustrated because i have been hearing the same advices over and over again to manage stress dont stay on screen too much be mindful of what you eat exercise have at least hours of sleep take breaks talk to people go out meditate etc etc and yeah those advices help to an extent but it seems like the main issue of why people are getting more and more stressed is never pointed out capitalism yeah okay we can do little things to feel better as individuals but at some point we need to have a collective answer to our problems because the stress were feeling isnt something we have total control over like take breaks cool but what if i cant because my boss wont let me exercise yeah okay but what if i cant because i have not enough moneytimeenergy because im poor and struggling to just make out a living meditate meditation has been prooved to me damagable if you dont do it correctly or if you have specific mental health issues like ruminations dont stay on screen to much what if its my job have hours of sleep what if i cant because i have insomnia and no doctors manage to give me a solution yet eat healthy what if i cant because its too expensive you get the idea here again im not saying those advices are bad they can help they helped me but im tired of hearing the same advices thrown at individuals as if there wasnt a global issue here its as if we were all living in a forest in fire and we individualy tried to reduce the heat by faning ourselves and drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated in my opinion we need to adress mental health problems politicaly what can we do together to feel better together you know what helped me more to reduce stress community giving and receiving help fighting for my rights with my fellas and winning some of those fights,,YouTube

key takeaways for quick navigation stress and burnout are prevalent issues with of people struggling with stress and experiencing burnout stress is higher than ever with of people having at least one feature of burnout and its affecting all age groups and industries an inability to disconnect from work including checking your phone excessively can be a sign of atypical burnout true resilience involves honoring boundaries selfcompassion and making space for rest and recovery not toxic resilience driven by productivity at all costs the rise in stress and burnout is not due to generational differences but is influenced by the hyperconnected world and collective trauma stress can have various physical manifestations like palpitations headaches neck pain and more these are unique to individuals and can be seen as their canary in the coal mine indicating stress the canary in the coal mine is a historical reference from coal mining where a canary was used to detect bad air quality similarly people have their own stress signals or canary songs that indicate stress its essential to see a doctor for a full workup to rule out any organic problems when experiencing stressrelated symptoms understanding your bodys physical manifestations of stress is crucial because these symptoms can serve as your personal canary song the main highway of stress in the brain and body is the hpa hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis which involves hormones like cortisol and adrenaline stress is not contagious like a virus but emotions and vibes can be contagious in social interactions the therapeutic presence in a doctorpatient relationship is essential for better health outcomes it involves qualities like authenticity empathy and making eye contact positive lifestyle changes even when beneficial can be stressful for the brain and may not last the rule of two suggests focusing on making two new changes at a time for better results the rule of two is based on a study by doctors holmes and rahi in the s which found that accumulating life events both positive and negative increased stress levels and the risk of developing illnesses later in life to make lasting changes its advised to implement two small changes at a time gradually building them into your routine whether its lifestyle changes or managing stress the first of the five resets to manage stress is to get clear on what matters most most to you this helps shift focus from selfpreservation to forward thinking and planning most stands for motivating objective small and timely its a framework to identify what goals matter most to you providing a roadmap to follow exercise even in small amounts can help manage stress it gets you out of your head increases selfefficacy and positively impacts mental health popcorn brain is a term describing the overstimulation and constant scrolling on our phones due to information overload its a common phenomenon in modern life the goal is not abstinence but creating digital boundaries with our phones to reduce reliance and decrease the number of times we check them thus improving mental health the speaker describes feeling in control most of the time but occasionally being in the back seat of life struggling to regain control emphasizing the importance of agency closing the gap between knowledge and action is essential and forming habits takes time emphasizing the importance of small consistent steps people should exercise for mental health benefits not just physical appearance and even a short walk can have a positive impact on stress and mental wellbeing taking short breaks during the day can help manage stress and boost productivity as demonstrated by a study from microsoft labs stress isnt necessarily bad its about maintaining a balance between healthy manageable stress and unhealthy stress the gutbrain connection is crucial for mental health and focusing on prebiotic and probiotic foods can help reset this connection watching the news late at night eating processed foods and having erratic meal times can contribute to stress and disrupt sleep multitasking is a myth true productivity comes from monotasking focusing on one task at a time as multitasking weakens the brains prefrontal cortex time blocking like the pomodoro technique involves setting a timer for focused work intervals eg minutes followed by short breaks which improves productivity and reduces stress multitasking can increase stress and reduce a sense of accomplishment so practicing monotasking through time blocking is more effective for productivity and mental wellbeing diaphragmatic breathing involves expanding the belly when inhaling and exhaling slowly which activates the parasympathetic nervous system reducing stress and increasing presence stop breathe and be for seconds to tap into the mindbody connection reduce stress and improve presence and focus expressive or therapeutic writing where you write about a traumatic event for minutes daily for four days can enhance mood sleep and overall wellbeing live a lifetime in a day involves incorporating elements of a meaningful life such as childhood work solitude vacation family and retirement even briefly each day to feel fulfilled and avoid the negative effects of hustle culture to counteract the negative impact of excessive phone use establish a media diet with time limits eg minutesday geographical limits keep the phone out of arms reach and logistical limits to maintain better mental health and reduce stress being informed and protecting mental health is essential seek help if facing mood disorders or anxiety hyperconnectivity and overconsumption of news can impact mental health negatively loneliness levels are rising globally and loneliness has significant health consequences comparable to smoking external appearances dont always reflect internal experiences be kinder and considerate to others chronic stress should not be glamorized aim for happiness fulfillment and connection in life made with harpa ai,,YouTube
there is plenty of research on the heart heart math has been pioneering this research for decades the heart registers truth immediately it is not intervened upon by the mind stress is transmissable we know this through lived experience we also know this through research in the fields of child development psychology and psychonuerobiology we are affraid to say stress is transmissable due to the fear of creating yet another discriminatory category or actions fair concern but truth is needed to cocreate meaningful solutions lastly you cannot teach a therapeutic relationship at least not based upon how we educate apprentiships are needed to see and experience a theraputic relationship modeled if you have never explicitly experienced as a part of your culture therapeutic relationships then you have no foundation in which to operate from it becomes another check list such as ask patient how their day was prior to giving a diagnosis a therapeutic relationship is only so when a healing presence is embodied that requires inner work and doing your own healing,,YouTube

id say being out in the woods on your own and constantly being in fear of predators is more stress inducing in a different way than having to pay bills take care of your kids have daily tasks and errands to run catering to your spouse etc yet still chronic stress in nature you experience intense fear but knowing that youre not in control of it in the human world youre fearful and stressed more because you know you should have more control of your stressors make more money have more help with your kids get all your grocery shopping done in one trip and stock up on things you use a lot put bills on autopay etc its stressful because we have too many things to control and stay on top of in the human world and its chaotic in nature its scary because you know you dont have that much control over what happens to you theyre stressful in opposite ways but i wouldnt say one is acute and one is chronic you would be chronically stressed out in nature as well the most peaceful life is somewhere in between the crazy busy city life and living completely out in the woods to your own devices,,YouTube

this is a great podcasti have been working as a teacher and it is demanding job no time to take a break to rest even though there are breaks between the lessons i do not get a break because there is always something that needs to be done needs to be solved colleagues come at you with other topics and information and things that we need to work on also i get so many messages that are work related during the day also during the time at work students ask many questions so when i am leaving the work i am overstimulated my brain feels like its going to explode as a teacher my job continues when i arrive home so those are evenings spent with work too after listening to the first or so minutes of this podcast i could relate to so many things especially the one about sleep since working my sleep has been the worst no matter what i do i just cant seem to improve it and there are so many things running around my head when i get to bed that it is impossible to fall asleep and i wake up during the night and i have to wake up early which makes me stressed even more so if someone thinks that being a teacher is easy it for sure is not the actual teaching in the classroom is the easiest the rest is just stressful and time consuming,This is a great podcasti has been working as a teacher and it is Demanding job no time to take a break to rest even though there are breaks between the lessons I do not get a break because there is always something topics and information and things that we need to work on also i get so many messages that are working related to the day also during the time at work students asking many questions so when I am leaving the work I am overstimulated my brain. I Arrive Home So Those Evenings Spent with Work Too After listening to the first or so minutes of this podcast I could relate to so many things especially the one about sleep since working my sleep has been the world no matter what I do I just cant. Around my head when I get to bed that it is impossible to fall asleep and i wake up during the night and I have to wake up early which makes me stressed even more so if someone thinks that being a teacher is easy it for surre is not the actual time consuming,YouTube

when you started listing up all the things you should do to be stressed at it sounded like the perfect description of my roommate weve been sharing a student apartment since and it was pretty good in the beginning when i worked from home during the pandemic because i took time to have breaks do some chores and make plans for both of us while he went to classes at university but when i got back to office everything went to shit so to speak my roommate stays inside of his room all day he wakes up between to pm when i just get back home from work he lives on energy drinks and takeout every time the door to his room opens a sweaty smell spreads across the apartment he gets no daylight or regular exercise i talked to him about it several times but it got progressively more difficult to speak when hes being shut in all the time its like trying to talk to a wall i had some compassion for his depression in the beginning but it started to affect me as well making me a bad friend who wont tolerate any of his negligence and thats why i decided to look for my own place this year he knows my decision so it wont come as a surprise when i do get an offer but i honestly cant wait to move out im sad to say it has ruined our friendship,,YouTube

sleep disorders fatigue and burnout are observed due to higher stress levels with of patient visits having a stressrelated component people experience an inability to disconnect from work with statistics showing individuals checking their phones up to times a day contributing to a sense of burnout dr aditi narukas journey as a stress expert began when she as a stressed medical student couldnt find help she became the doctor she needed uncovering solutions beyond mere relaxation unprecedented levels of stress are observed globally affecting all industries and demographics mental health stress and burnout are gaining recognition breaking taboos in various sectors stress rates are at an alltime high with of people experiencing burnout and struggling with stress the recent years have been noted as the most stressful in many professionals careers the difference between acute and chronic stress is explained emphasizing that chronic stress leading to burnout doesnt allow the brain time to rest or recharge impacting overall wellbeing burnout symptoms are evolving with of cases showing an inability to disconnect from work atypical burnout can manifest in seemingly engaged individuals who struggle to unplug addiction to work can be a sign of burnout when it interferes with sleep relationships and daily life highlighting the changing face and definition of burnout toxic resilience characterized by productivity at all costs and a mindovermatter mindset is contrasted with true resilience emphasizing the need for rest recovery and selfcompassion the societal glorification of toxic resilience reflected in messages like keep calm and carry on contributes to the misconception that dealing with discomfort is the essence of resilience which needs to be debunked resilience is discussed in the context of different generations challenging the stereotype that older generations were more resilient due to harder labor with the acknowledgment that each generation faces unique challenges the canary in the coal mine analogy explains the physical manifestations of stress it refers to our bodys unique signals indicating stress like palpitations headaches or gastrointestinal issues the hpa axis hypothalamus pituitary adrenal is the brains stress information highway chronic stress keeps this axis active leading to persistent hormone surges especially cortisol causing various health issues stress is not contagious like a virus but emotions and vibes can be the hearts electromagnetic field may influence how people perceive each others vibes or emotional states the therapeutic encounter in healthcare involves creating a sense of equality compassion and empathy simple actions like sitting at eye level can enhance the perceived care and engagement in medical interactions authenticity in the human voice plays a crucial role in building connections the voice triggers deepseated instincts from infancy fostering a sense of authenticity vulnerability and likability in human interactions the resilience rule of two explains how our brains adapt to change positive changes require embracing discomfort twice first accepting the change and second adapting to the new situation fostering brain plasticity positive lifestyle changes such as reducing stress can be challenging to sustain due to the brains limited capacity for simultaneous changes the rule of two is based on a study by holmes and rahi suggesting that positive life changes also stress the brain advising to focus on two changes at a time for effective adaptation in clinical practice incremental changes by focusing on two aspects at a time are emphasized for managing stress and achieving longterm goals the first reset involves getting clear on what matters most most motivating objective small timely to combat stress and engage the prefrontal cortex for better decisionmaking the stress score helps in the first reset understanding the patients stress level while setting most goals motivating objective small timely creates a roadmap for stress management exercise even in small amounts like a minute walk has significant benefits for stress management and mental health improving selfefficacy and reducing anxiety popcorn brain is a term for the brains overstimulation due to excessive online activity driven by a primal urge to constantly scan for danger especially during stressful times to combat popcorn brain its essential to establish digital boundaries and reconsider the relationship with the phone rather than seeking complete abstinence aiming for a healthier use stressinduced emotional eating is a biological response the amygdala focused on survival craves highfat highsugar foods during stressful periods understanding and managing these cravings is crucial acknowledge the struggle with stress but focus on regaining control practice and knowledge help closing the gap between knowledge and action is crucial for habitbuilding and stress reduction start with small achievable actions for stress relief such as a minute walk to build momentum exercise for mental health rather than cosmetic reasons even a minute walk positively impacts stress biology honor breaks in the workday microsoft study shows that minute breaks reduce stress and boost mood not all stress is bad differentiate between adaptive good and maladaptive bad stress for a healthier life foster a healthy gutbrain connection through sleep diet exercise and stress reduction focus on prebiotic and probiotic foods humorous but poignant the day plan to maximize anxiety and stress involves habits like latenight screen exposure and irregular eating multitasking weakens the prefrontal cortex impacting problemsolving concentration mood and engagement monotasking through time blocking is a more effective approach diaphragmatic breathing also known as belly breathing is an effective stress reduction technique inhale through the nose expand the belly and exhale slowly through the mouth stop breathe be a quick mindfulness technique to switch from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system reducing stress and promoting presence therapeutic writing expressive writing for minutes daily about a traumatic event has been proven to improve mood sleep anxiety and even increase gpa live a lifetime in a day incorporate elements of childhood work solitude vacation family and retirement daily to bring fulfillment and meaning into life countering the hustle culture implement a media diet by setting time limits keeping the phone away during work and creating logistical boundaries reducing stress and enhancing mental health consuming graphic content such as videos and images increases the risk of ptsd and mental health conditions emphasizing the need for moderation and awareness in media consumption being an informed citizen is crucial but establishing digital boundaries is equally important for mental health overconsumption of news especially graphic content can lead to mental health issues seek counseling if experiencing distress excessive phone use contributes to a sense of hyperconnectivity but actual disconnection fueling a global loneliness epidemic loneliness is a health concern equated to smoking cigarettes a day increasing heart disease and stroke risks internal experiences may not align with external appearances kindness is vital as everyone is facing unseen struggles stress and resilience terminologies need reframing chronic stress should not be glamorized and a nuanced middle ground is crucial empathetic communication is key understanding the humanity in individuals work fosters connection and success feedback is valuable continuous learning and reinforcing beliefs through feedback contribute to personal and professional growth,,YouTube

working at fast food does not give you that option mainly because its a job were youre suppose to deliver a service or role and be able to give it consistently and fast some jobs like doing the dishes in the back is easy no real rush and you can listen to music and podcasts because no one will see you either than the manager and your coworkers and it doesnt require you to listen to someone else so what i like to do is just before work like the night of my day off i would take all the music i like and put it in a collection list and have it on autoplay then when i goto work and i get put back on dishes i can simply just put on my headphones my cleaning gear like gloves and apron and clean away while listening to my favorite music because of the simplicity of doing dishes i can listen to music without impairing my ability to do the dishes however if youre a cashier fry cook or responsible for making sure the order a customer ordered is right and delivering it to them you cant just listen to music you cant hear orders customers will complain and then the manager will have to inform you that you cant wear headphones at work or play music even if youre the only one playing it out loud because nobody cares about your taste in music with the flexible scheduling where the employee has control over their own schedule you can either end up being so overstaffed that the managers just send some people home or understaffed where they have to either close half the store like only allowing drive thru orders to be taken or close entirely and in instances where the drivethru is the only thing thats open now we have even more complaints over their order taking so long to be made i dont have much faith in my workplace letalone for fastfood employment anymore since work is already draining in of itself and making food really fast seems not only like the most unproductive compared to what i could be doing but also like an impossibility considering the fact that the food i usually eat takes more than minutes to make and i find that more enjoyable than whatever i do at work were understaffed and that no one gets paid sick leave so they end up going to work and hiding their illness and bring down an illness onto nearly everyone that works there and to top it all off a person in line that is going hangry because he didnt get his order the moment he parked at the window where he would get his meal,Working at fast food does not give you that option mainly because it is a job were youre suppose to deliver a service or role and be able to give it consistent and fast some jobs like the dishes in the back is easy no real rush and you can listen to music and podcasts because no no one Either than the manager and your coworkers and it dalsnt requires you to listen to someone so what I like to do is just before work like the night of my day off i wild take all the music I like and put it in a collection list and have I can simply just put on my headphones my cleaning gear like gloves and apron and clean away while listening to my favorite music because of the simplicity of doing dishes i can listen to music without impairing my abilities to do the dishe. Making surre the order a customer order is right and delivering it to them you can just listen to music you cant hear orders customers will complain and then the manager will have to inform you that you can wear headphones at work or play music events if youure the only one playing it out of the one out loud becae nobody cars. about your taste in music with the flexible scheduling where the employee has control over their own you can either end up being so overstaffed that the managers are just some people home or understaffed where they have to either close the store. Orders to be taken or close entirely and in instances where the drivethru is the only things open now we have even more complaints over their order taking so long to be made I dont has much faith in my workplace lethala for Draining in of its self and making food really fast like only like the most unproductive comparated to what I could be doing but also like an impossibility considering the fact that the food i usually eat takes more than minutes to make and i find that more enjoyable Understanding and that no one gets paid sick leave so they end up going up to work and hiding their illness and bring down an illness onto nearly everyone that works there and to top it all off a person in line that is going to hanging because would get his meal,YouTube

i think this advice speaks to a very spesific group of people who are self employed or in a more flexible position for me this way of thinking falls down at the first step because the most work that needs to be done does not always create value and even then the valuegenerating work needed to be feasible is escalateing to the point of impossibly my partner and i are coming to terms with the fact that after half a decade of grinding hard work and forgoing many luxuries we are effectively further away from even our most conservative goals and its because life involves family responsibility work and medical emergency work and social work and trauma work and unforseen accident work and global pendemic work and child care work you could argue that there is value there but it is not transferable hell i would kill to have time to do something creative or to take time to learn things that could put me in a better position or to financially benefit from the things im passionate about but that means im risking rent or im coming up short for my meds or im sacrificing meals,I think this advice speaks to a very specific group of people who are self -employed or in a more flexible position for me this way of thinking falls down at the first step because the most work that needs to be done does not always always know and even this way of feasible is escalating to the point of impossibly my partner and i are coming to the fact with the fact after half a decade of grinding hard work and forgoing many luxuries we are effectively further away from the most most common conservative goals and Responsibility of Work and Medical Emergency Work and Social Work and Trauma Work and Unforseen Accident Work and Global Pendemic Work and Child Care Work You Could Argue that there is values ​​there but it is not transferred hell I would kill To learn things that could put me in a better position or to financially benefit from the things im passionate about but that means im risking rent or im coming up short for my social or im sacrificing meals,YouTube

id like to point out that a simple vacation doesnt necessarily cure a persons burnout especially in situations where they are burnt out from their career in general compassion fatigue for example can become a permanent issue because someone has a hard time witnessing horrible things over and over again ie nursing doctors dentists vets it might also not cure it because the job permanently has really high demands and pressure so the vacation gives you a nice break but you still go back to the high demand job,,YouTube

is an instant reply inherently unnatural is what i am wondering since that is sort of like the default method of human communication like under innate human behavior an instant reaction or reply is more likely and more normal than one that were to occur minutes days weeks months later like before with letters a question could take months to be replied to in older cases even years it might be that the fact that this innate reflex to reply instantly is being abused and exploited and it is in fact that what is making the condition manifest and not the instant reply in and of itself,,YouTube

depression is an state of the mind where brain is just focusing on a big problem you can be at a wedding in a party funeral alone or whatever and your brain will be remembering you about that simple problem burnout is an state of the mind where the brain focus on everything that need to be done for a long period of time and the moment you take a break the brain just remember everything that needs to be done and drains your mental or physical energy either way burnout and depression leads to inefficiency pd i have gone through depression and overcome it but im in a huge burnout stage if someone has gone through long burnout stages and overcome it tips will be appreciated thank you,,YouTube
i actually looked at this video thinking it was in general but i guess not my home and my young adult are the ones making me burned out thank you anyway,,YouTube
well i have to work yeah i felt that down to my bones to be honest im not sure if im severely burnt out or maybe feeling depressed im just tired and i mean that literally i can sleep hours and still be dead tired the next day when i do have a two week vacation i tend to and that is no joke sleep away the first week to maybe get things done in the second one just to find myself shutting out the world and all the people in it and to very likely watch movies or read books for the entire second week without actually getting things done when people message me it can take upt to a month or sometimes months for me to find the energy to reply as said in the video it seems really hard to tell apart depression from a burn out and for me a lot of the issues on both sides fit and its not even that i am unhappy or feeling down all the time is just this bone deep tiredness that makes me shut out everyone and everything that may require of me to take action or cope with other peoples issuesemotions and normally after a greathappy timeday i tend to shut myself away to balance it out so to speak probably sounds weird written down like this i mean in my head i know it but still i need to ask is that something that i should see a therapist about or might a change of job or a longer medical leave help,,YouTube

wow this video explained so well what im going through ive been so burned out and it led to depression my job is stressful and then i come home to the nd shift of house hold duties also dealing with a sick mother thats always needing me to do something im so burned out it sucks it makes my life not enjoyable,,YouTube
plot twist my depression led to total life burnout when i struggle to get out of bed and do the things i need to do combined with the utter lack of selfesteem and sense of anything it compounds the burnout and im less functional when depressed im mostly burned out with being a single mom im fortunate enough when i got burned out by freelancing i was able to dissolve the business and create a new one that supported my mental health and energy levels better if someone puts me on a resort island id probably just have a succession of panic attacks unless i was allowed to work work has become a coping mechanism to stuff away the depression and impending sense of doom,,YouTube
yeah i kinda starting to feel burnout slowly taking over my life before changing jobs i was more energetic and looking forward to life hobbies but now it seems that my job consumes everything and addition to that my boyfriend is feeling more and more distant from me and that drains my energy even more and the lack of physical activities then you start to think that maybe being an artist that doesnt have much money but does what they love is not that bad after all that lonely life is better than pretending to be happy in a shape you dont fit,,YouTube
thank you for helping me identify what the issue was i feel much better now that i can actually name how im feeling,,YouTube

see i dont know what i have it doesnt feel like burnout it feels like total stagnation i do feel like whats the point of waking up but i still want to keep my life not because of any one person or thing but because i genuinely want to see myself flourish im only a teenager so i dont have a job and there arent any major stressors in my life idk anymore,,YouTube
i think im experiencing more of burnout than depression i do have insomnia right now and slight loss of appetite i think i just need to get out of my usual routine,,YouTube
great video presentation burnout can be on the way to depression dr marks differentiates the two very well the big issue of course is whether workers need to be on the slippery slope into depression some may not know but mental disorders such as clinical depression robs people of life expectancy so if you were supposed to live to you could get years less workers need to ask themselves serious questions if they score highly one one or more of the three domains of the maslach i suggest the following is it me or is my organisation doing this to me are other people around me burnt out and suffering with other workprecipitated mental disorders eg anxiety disorders depression substance misuse disorders why have i got to this point how long has all this been going on why have they not fixed the system after so long because burnout doesnt just develop overnight how likely are they to fix workplace issues in the next months should i hold on in this job for or more months im not clinically depressed now but what if succumb and develop clinical depression what would that mean should i allow myself to be made ill on the job what should i do next obviously i cant answer those questions for each person nor can i advise what to do next but just asking oneself the questions and being honest is better than not,,YouTube

definitely burned out by my job its been years and im feeling it i initially thought this job would drive me crazy quickly but it was alright for awhile now i kinda hate it and feel undervalued and feeling like im not paid enough makes me feel even more of the why bother but i cant figure out what type of job would be enjoyable but this job is too simple i need to use my mind im always bored,,YouTube
this makes sense and i kinda feel like now i understand exactly why im burned out my job itself isnt stressful but my coworkers have a tendency to make a lot of inappropriate jokes and things to the point of being low key sexual harassment everyone treats me nice but i just dont feel comfortable sometimes or like i fit in at all i want to leave but i dont have a drivers license and its just down the road so my parents dont have to drive me far i feel stuck,,YouTube

first time i have seen your videos and really like how you present things so looking forward to watching more im definitely depressed but burnout has also been a factor in getting there as there has been a big conflict between my personality and the type of work i needed to do ventured there due to no jobs on my own field and then got stuck there ive had a hellish few years with my health exposure to toxins in an ill office building that started an army of symptoms that took years to get over and it all started eating my endurance under pressurestress then several people dying relationship ending suddenly my dog dying then another abusive relationship with a narcissist who completely destroyed me by gaslighting and futurefaking and traumatizing me to a point that all my childhood trauma resurfaced and i fell into depression i wanted nothing more than to just die but i got into therapy instead i am still very much in recovery especially because when i was somehow ready to enter normal life again covid happened and i was thrown back into isolation after already being in selfisolation for couple years due to depression all of this reduced me to a mere pale reflection of who i am i lost all my immense creativity and drive i still feel constant fatigue i barely recognize myself and i need to rebuild my life bit by bit but its been an uphill battle with all these things coming at me all the time i just feel like i can get no break whatsoever as a cherry on the cake few months ago my spinal disc bulged out into the spinal canal and ive been in pain and on the verge of losing function on my leg dreadful pain for several months but the leg is fine now but i may still end up on an operating table because things are very unstable so yea i had burnout at the very beginning but now it has been fullon depression for years during the burnout at the very beginning in addition to burnout symptoms i also had physical symptoms that indicate i was already close to depression stomach issues feeling very anxious about even going back to work etc followed by irregular sleeping patterns and constant fatigue even my thyroid went nuts due to the exposure to toxins at the work place permanent sinus damage three new allergies it was hell even before i fell into depression but depression is so much worse you just lose your will to live i prayed in my bed at night that there would be a pill that i could swallow that would just end it all i consider it a miracle that i am still here,first time I have like your videos and really like how you present things so looking forward to watching more im definitely but burnout has also been a factor in getting there as there has been a big conflict between no jobs on my own field and then got stuck there Ive had a hellish few years with my health exposure to toxins in an Ill office building that started an army of symptoms that store years years Dying Relationship Ending Suddenly My Dog Dying Then Another Abusive Relationship with a Narcissist Who Completely Destroyed Me by Gaslighting and Futurefaking and Traumatizing Me to a Point That All My Childhood die but i got into therapy incent i am still very much in recovery estially because when I was somehow ready to enter normal life. Pale Reflection of Who I am I lost all mynse Creativity and drive I Still Feel Constant Fatigue I Barely Recognize Myself and I Need To Rebuild My Life Bit by Bit But ITS Been An Uphill Battle with All These Whatsoever as a cherry on the cake few months ago my spinal disc it is bulged out into the spinal canal and ive been in pain and on the verge of losing function on my leg dreadful pain for several months but the leg is fine now had burnout at the very beginning but now it has been fullon depression for years during the burnout at the very beginning in addition to burnout symptoms i also had physical symptoms that indicate i was already close to depression stomach issues feelings. etc followed by irregular sleeping patterns and constant fatigue even my thyroid went nuts due to the exposure to toxins at the work place permanent sinus damage Three new allergic it was HELL even before I Fell Into Depression But Depression Live I Prayed in My Bed At Night that there would be a pill that I could swallow that would just end it all I consider it a miracle that I am still here,YouTube

listen the video really helped me break the illusion that someone is going to help me however when you mentioned going to the gym when tired i just really didnt understand the emotional logic or the logical logic i mean maybe if your body is tired its trying to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity myself i am already burnt out and you tell me go to the gym thats not gonna restore me thats gonna waste more of my time that could be devoted to something more productive such as figuring out a way to escape the cycle of hour work weeks i mean instead of going to the gym ive figure out how to save a couple bucks so i dont have to work the extra bring on the four day work weeks please also your point about streamers not succeeding compared to being a doctor kinda destroys the point i mean a steamer is a career doing one of the most relaxing things possible but in a very structured and organised manner that is designed to be entertaining comparing it to being a doctor is ridiculous people become doctors due to overt pressures placed on them by family and society and can be a very taxing job with a high entry level think of all the people working run down jobs whos parents wished them to become doctors years of training in the uk to become fully qualified vs years of work and streaming to maybe become successful two different goals and entirely different kinds of people not only that to get into university to get money to study is much higher than trying to be a streamer and buying a webcam and a pc also your saying your trying to help people but people dont watch twitch for help they watch it like generic tv these days but we always need doctors and we always need entertainment hopefully one day its just entertainment needed more than doctors so your twitch career wasnt going to take off anytime soon i do not have enough experience but as a viewer im telling you id rather watch some random play a game i like than get advice on all my problems your bringing problems to escapism haha my last point i wanted to touch on is thank you for this video it provides that forward looking logic that is missing from hour work weeks but i think that for these kinds of issues maybe some financial advice or a careers advisor may come in better place or just as an addition to your video edit yeah phones are messed up man too much nonsense that just takes it out of you thats the kind of entertainment thats destroying you anyway i hope you can see the passion in my reaction and not some sort of resentment to this kind of content,listen to the video really helped me break the illusion that someone is going to help me howver when you are mentioned to go to the gym when tired i just really understood the emotional logic or the logical logic i mean may be your body body myself i am already burnt out and you tell me to go to the gym that not gonna restore me that gonna waste more of my time could be devoted to something more production as figuring out a way to escape the cycle of hour out how to save a couple bucks so i dont has to work the extra bring on the four day work weeks please also your point about streamers not sucteding comparated to being a doctor kinda destroys the point i mean a steamer is a career doing one of the most. structured and organized manner that is designed to be entertaining comparing it to being a doctor is ridiculous people become dystors due to overt pressures placed on them by family and society and can be a very taxing job with a high entry level Parents wished them to Become Doctors years of training in the uk to Become fully qualified vs years of work and streaming to maybe become successful two different goals and entirely different kinds of people not only that Higher than trying to be a streamer and buying a webcam and a PC Also your saying your trying to help people but people dont watch twitching for help they watch it like generic tv these days but we always need doctors and we always need Needed more than Doctors so your twitch career wasnt going to take off anytime soon i do not have enough experience but as a viewer im. Touch on is thank you for this video provides that forward looking logic that is missing from hour work weeks but i think that for these kinds of issues may be some financial advice or a careers advice may come in better place or just nonsense that just takes it out of you the kind of entertainment that destroy you anyway I hope you can see the passion in my reaction and not some sort of resentment to this kind of content,YouTube

in my opinon this is where individual therapy ends and cannot compensate with the faulty system in place in america and generally speaking in europe we have moved towards a neoliberal economy outsourcing much of our production this has increased local inequality and has led to a significant imbalance of power between lowermiddle class workers and private owners most laws voted on go against the interests of lowermiddleclass workers until we reduce inequality in our countries we cannot hope for a better life while there are some examples of social mobility these tend to fall within the survival bias where i can agree with you is that we cannot fall into the passive acceptation of the situation its quite the opposite its time to act on it politically,in my opinon this is where individual therapy ends and cannot compensate with the faulty system in place in america and generally speaking in europe we have moved towards a neoliberal economy outsourcing Significant Chance of Power between Lowermiddle Class Workers and Private Owners Most Laws Voted on Go Against the Interests of Lowermiddleclass Workers Until We Reduce Inhequality in Our Countries We Cannot Hope for a Better Life While While There Are These tend to fall within the survival bias where I can agree with you is that we can not fall into the passive acceptation of the situation,YouTube

Texts i barely look at my phone these days to maintain the semblance of social interaction no time for hobbies or passions it makes it hard to feel theres much worth living for when you are not even allowed to live just allowed to survive a life.

i have to disagree where the tirednesscomes from h of work are not the same at every place having a toxic workplace with unreachable expectations no job training and too high density and responsibility leads to chronic stress you can not train and adapt to that for more than a year i tried to convince myself once i am better in this task it will get easier it didnt the tasks just got even more i ended with stress related hair loss and chronic headache aswell as untreated inflammations the h job i work now is half the workload and pays more sorry but saying all ofyou are just tired because you are addicted to your phones is a dangerous oversimplification also being always just one misstep away from homelessness prevents you from setting healthy boundaries at work towards your colleagues towards your clients and customers and towards your boss you stop saying no so the risk rises to be mistreated and molested and to get even more workload which makes you angry and exhausted even more quality of work and workplace is important yet depending where you live the number of places to chose from can be highly limited,I have to disagree where the tirednesscomes from H of work are not the same at every place having a toxic workplace with unreacquable expectations no job training and too high density and responsibility leads to chronic stress you can CONVINCE MYSELF ONCE I AM Better in this task it will get easier it in the tasks just got even more i ended with stress related hair loss and chronic headche aswell as an untreated inflammations the hob Addicted to your phones is a dangerous oversimplification Also being always Always just one missing away from homelessness prevents you from the healthy settings.

im honestly quite disappointed in dr k here hes basically saying the world sucks now because rich people have figured out how to extract every gram of productivity from you but then he says im not anticapitalism and basically you need to suck it up the more you do it the more resilient you will become to it and if not you might have a mental illness or you need to use your phone which has been optimized for making you addicted to it less i know its harder for americans to understand since you have an extreme form of capitalism and have been even more brainwashed by it than most other first world countries but the solution to this is to take wealth back from the rich probably through taxes this is what made the baby boomer generation have oportunitines humanity is wealthier as a whole now that it has ever been and life still sucks for most people and the reason for this is inequality there is a _lot_ of wealth and the rich have most of it the only solution for that is organization sure you can probably do some stuff like dr k said to make your life suck less but this will only get you so far voting for billionaries and expecting them to have your interest at heart is ludicrous organizing to take wealth back from the rich is hard but its doable it has been done before when people got fed up take a look at gary stevensons youtube channel if you find what im saying to be unreasonable,im honestly quite disappointed in from k here hes basically saying the world sucks now because rich people have fallen out how to extract every gram of productivity from you but then he says im not anthicapitalism and basically you need to suck it up to the more. it and if not you might have a mental illness or you need to use your phone which has been optimized for making you addicted to it less i know its harder for Americans to understand since you have an extreme form of capitalism and have Countries but the solution to this is to take wealth back from the rich probably through taxes this is what made the baby boomer generation have opportunities humanity is wealthier there is a _lot_ of wealth and the rich have most of it the only solution for that is organization surre you can probably do some stuff likes from k say to make your life suck less but this will be only you so far voting for billionaries and expecting them and expecting them and expecting them. ludicrous organizing to take wealth back from the rich is hard but its doable it has been done before when people fed up take a look a look at Gary Stevensons Youtube channel if you find what im saying to be unreasonable,YouTube

hey dr k ive learned a lot from you so far and im really grateful for that now that were getting into economics and the reasons why its becoming harder for people to make a living i hope i can show you something in return the reason why were being paid less and less over time isnt because of efficiency or because weve figured things out its due to the inflationary monetary system technological progress and increased efficiency should actually mean that everything becomes cheaper over time because we can produce things more effectively but heres the problem lets say people have become on average more efficient at producing goods that would typically lead to deflation a decrease in prices however since central banks have a mandate to aim for inflation ie price increases they will actively work against that deflation this means any natural deflation is systematically eliminated and on top of that an additional inflation is deliberately targeted unfortunately the incentives are also set up so that central banks always manage to achieve those inflation figures and since they calculate inflation themselves they also have an incentive to make the numbers look better than they are for example by adjusting the basket of goods used to measure inflation to include cheaper or lowerquality items that have lower price increases while removing higherquality goods that have risen more in price on top of that the cpi consumer price index only includes consumer goods it excludes assets like real estate since rising credit levels dont necessarily lead to a proportional increase in demand for consumer goods but rather for assets like real estate asset prices tend to rise far more than the cpi does because wages are usually only adjusted according to the cpi which as mentioned is both manipulated and incomplete real wages fall over time in terms of what people can actually afford thats why it keeps getting harder to make ends meet even though on paper it looks like wages are keeping up with inflation so the real issue isnt efficiency its the inflationary monetary system much love and please keep up the amazing work youre doing,,YouTube

millennial here something ive noticed over the years with enjoyment of work and maybe it could be expanded on a bit the term enjoy doesnt mean im having fun and everything is smiles and happiness unless you are in a rare super lucky situation try to frame it as i feel my work is important i know what i need to be competent and accomplish the work and i have the autonomy to complete it if you are passionate about something and are rewarded in the ways that matter to you the time you spend working on it becomes insignificant and the tiredness you feel each day week is more like a levellingup experience that can fluctuate depending on the context and role you are in but when it starts to trend toward not important not clear and or not autonomous then you are probably not enjoying the work dr k has great videos on burnout relating to this then there is the tiredness factor of this video older generations benefitted from the relative calm of life without the internet and everything was accessed through physical participation which set up resilient habits to live well on in general this is what dr k is referring to about exercise and tiredness an athletes tiredness is no different to an amateurs tiredness except for the amount of practice theyve had at getting tired and noticing improvements over time the problem we face now is that we are oversaturated with digital access to infinite information so the older generations have the advantage of those established habits but the younger gens are less likely to have those natural skills and some dont know how to step away from it something that used to be normal and was easy to access before the internet became ubiquitous in the late s early s we might have a few select advantages but there are so many external debuffs stacked on us that simply pushing a high amount of effort is quickly negated by the elite endgame players so society now has no choice but to apply substantial effort to avoid the saturated noise so that we can fit enjoyment of things back in to our preinternet biology we actually have to perform work on enjoyment of work so that the work we perform is actually enjoyable p,,YouTube

as a yearold gen z professional with two years of work experience ive developed a clear what i can do about it philosophy for navigating my career and personal growth embrace calculated risks playing it safe wont get me where i want to be im choosing to embrace more risk particularly in my investments and career path for instance im shifting away from overpriced bluechip stocks and opting for more dynamic investments while most of my current portfolio is in gold a hedge against potential global instability im also willing to jobhop more frequently this includes taking on roles with the inherent risk of not passing probation or being among the first for layoffs master the ai revolution i believe were at a pivotal point similar to how ancient rome transitioned to a slavebased economy ultimately leading to chaos due to unemployment our world faces a similar threat with the rise of ai to thrive we must learn to leverage ai to automate work through products and services my focus is on deeply understanding how to build design market and utilize ai cultivate hope and connection as highlighted in various discussions maintaining a sense of future prospect is crucial for sustained energy and motivation my personal goal is to gain experience in a developed country for years before returning to southeast asia this offers significant leverage due to currency differences its about finding your own version of hope that fuels your drive prioritize fast recharge hobbies and meaningful friendships i used to maintain an intense hour workday including weekends balancing a startup job and college while i gradually built up to this workload i found myself completely exhausted and lost after about years now that ive graduated i prioritize fast recharge hobbies instead of mindlessly scrolling social media im selective about consuming highly recommended anime or manga ive also gravitated towards upbeat music and most importantly i dedicate time to friends with whom i have genuine connections im not afraid to cut off relationships that dont serve me or limit interactions to once a quarter if thats whats best for my wellbeing,,YouTube

i like how you talk about it being expectations based an anecdote from my own life i went though all of elementary middle and high school never procrastinating and studying a lot and making sure i got all straight as cuz i was told by the shcools that i needed to do that to get into a good college so i could get a good job and live a good life my parents never really hounded on me cuz i did get straight as all the time so then i get into the good college and again i never procrastinating and studied a lot and made sure i got straight as most of the time so i could then get a good job i also played a sport in college like i did in school growing up and i wanted to play more so i took a masters program at the same college same thing again dont procrastinate use all the campus resources study hard i graduated at the top of the class for my cohort so then im like okay sick now i get to get a job and be set the rest of my life a couple months go by no real progress with interviews thats okay its the summer and im enjoying having finished all my schooling thats fine i move back in with my parents more months go by no job theyre like hey man you need to have a job and im like i thought i was supposed to have one by now i did all the steps i sacrificed having a ton of fun because i was forwarding thinking trying to better my future self a couple more months go by and i find some part time work to appease my parents i still havent found a job related to my masters degree after over a year finally after a couple more months i get an offer to work full time its not very much pay but at least its something and i end up having to move across the entire country to do it i think for a lot of people who are around my age im rn its just sucks to feel like you followed the path you were told to follow and check all the boxes but life just doesnt actually work that way it kinda feels like we got lied to and then were expected to just hate ourselves and suffer so people who are super rich can get even richer a second anecdote related tertiary to what the girl int eh video was saying i truly and honestly have no clue how people in the generations before us had jobs and were able to live healthy lives i guess maybe they didntdont if you look at the illnesses so many people have but like i mentioned i played a sport in college and i still play it now and look i wasnt good enough to go pro but i was around people who did and we were all on the same team and so wed do the same habits tracking all your calories making sure youre eating the right macros optimizing your sleep working out at the gym training sessions mental performance work just general therapy and relaxation time to make sure you perform at your best working hours a day makes it extremely difficult to take care of your health youre stuck at work for those hours unable to leave so you need to do your gym time before or after but you also need to make sure to meal prep your lunch so you can eat something nutritious at work lunch so you need to sort out when you can go to the gym and when you can prep your meals that already cuts some hours out of your day then you have to commute to and from work and to and from the gym you can choose to do that before work or after work either of those choices will impact when you go to sleep but you need to make sure you can get at least hours of sleep to perform well when its all said in done you basically have hours left in each workday to use on leisure activities at least in my experience and maybe this is the privilege talking but how is that enough time and this is if you have the drive to actually be able to do the relaxing stuff like the girl said its exhausting working id never experienced stress in school because i would work ahead to finish all my assignments and prepare for my tests you have a rewarding period at the end that you work towards thats what we were taught in school but thats not what a is like it never ends there is no test theres nothing to study for theres no end why the heck are we taught this workflow pattern for our entire lives if thats not what the real world is like no wonder people dont eat healthy no wonder they dont work out no wonder they get poor sleep doing all those things to stay healthy takes some work and discipline but now youre getting yelled at by your boss at work in a constant state of stress with no end in sight people dont have the bandwidth for all of that the other generations having the audacity to call us lazy is myopic to me at least we had the drive to create some positive change for people to live healthier lives just because things have been done a certain way for a long time doesnt make them right and at least to me in the present day those methods dont work anymore idk would love to here any other gen z people my age give their thoughts on this is this how youre feeling too i know im currently trying to leave my current job and find something where you can actually live a healthy life maybe thats why so many people just become influencers its a way to have a balanced day even if its mostly pedaling scam products to impressionable people or rage baiting at least you have the opportunity to have some work life balance maybe im just salty that i wasnt good enough to go pro or i wasnt networked enough to get a really good job with my masters but it does kinda feel like i worked really hard for no reason well anyhoo these videos always help me out a lot when im struggling with stuff so keep up with the good content and i hope some other people get something from my text walls up there haha glhf,,YouTube

the point of having undiagnosed medical condition is so true for a long as i could remember i was constantly tired during my late teens and early s like the point was i can instantly fall asleep anywhere and it turns out i had severe sleep apnea now that ive got it treated the difference is night and day but heres the kicker i only realised it during covid lockdowns when i had time to focus on myself and realise that my tiredness is not due to not sleeping enough and i was able to get the necessary treatment because im on a good insurance plan and can afford it so if someone else with less than ideal situation has sleep apnea or other undiagnosed medical condition they would be struggling for their whole lives not realising they were playing the game of life with a smaller dice,,YouTube

as a genz my honest opinion is we dont give our parents and grandparents enough credit on how hard they had to work sure it was easier but it was still difficult the practical methods they used probably wont work in modern times but the principles are the same also i noticed that when you hear the word years it does not sound like that much but going through years were your making sacrifices and pushing through discomfort or giving up some things you might enjoy would feel like a lifetime a lot of the core skills and cognitive abilities you need to succeed in modern society do not come naturally to a lot of people also paying month for rent when your only making kmonth does not make sense get a roommate and now you just halved it or downsize,,YouTube

part of the issue is us we werent taught how to save and invest money or get real skills or stop being on our phones for hours a day while they drain our energy hell im approaching a lot of kids younger than me have it way harder than me even interacting face to face and getting out of the house then theres other things like this garbage housing crisis that they have us blaming on these big funds that buy up houses but really its mostly in my opinion a bunch of nimbyism across the country where everyone complains about housing prices but no area wants to step up and build houses i live in a super liberal area and im liberal myself they wanted to build new apartments here and everyone flipped out it would increased traffic it would do xyz its like at some point if all these governments and populations and zoning boards dont allow housing to be built were gonna be in a situation like we are now where its super hard to buy a home we are also weaker in many ways fundamentally my parents both commuted minutes plus back and forth into the city theyd leave the house around ish and come home around pm they didnt grow up with money and they gladly did it for good money for us now we think going back to the office isnt even a fair thing im not saying it is or it isnt but things bother us way more now than they ever did before i bet for of us and im not excluding myself if they audited their average week they have spent at least hours scrolling on social media playing video games watching tv browsing reddit etc we need to figure out how to take our minds and our focus back and its really difficult also is it just me or did of commenters not watch the video and assumed dr k said what they think,,YouTube

i think this video needs a little more nuance or at least a note of caution especially since there are now many more people with postviral fatigue conditions following the covid pandemic and it has been shown that exercise is actively harmful if you have certain kinds of post viral illness or myalgic encephalomyelitis there is of course also a psychological component to many kinds of chronic fatigue syndrome but there have been cases where people have literally died because they have been prescribed graded exercise therapy because their chronic fatigue was not solely psychological or mental but rather followed a viral infection which changed the physiological mitochondrial energy metabolism mechanism on a cell level and we finally have more biomolecular research to to show the physiological mechanisms behind exercise prescriptions harming certain groups of people with mecfs given the dr k is a medical doctor i would generally expect a little more caution in giving this type of advice to a generation of young people who have just lived through a pandemic that caused post viral illness on an extremely large scale,I think this video needs a little more nuance or at least a note of cases estially since there are now many people with postviral fatigue conditions follow the covid pandemic and it has been shown that exercise is active.

i empathize with people struggling right now but honest to god a perspective change is needed for some of these people to survive and then someday thrive it is true a social contract was broken at some point we built society to circumvent the reality that survival is not guaranteed at any other point point in history you would be working all day every single day just to survive and it still wasnt a guarantee yes the system has been unfairly optimized but that can change and you can also change your circumstances to rebalance it back into your favor in fact you have to do that thats what survival is it is unfair that others might be more privileged or have been in the past but like dr k stated complaining about it does nothing to help you and i mean that as sympathetically as i can i want people to survive and get to a better place so you have to acknowledge the reality embrace it then move forward any way you can to try to change it this seems to be too emotionally heavy for people to cope with but if you just realize that all of the extra stuff was never guaranteed for most of human history you might find that even the worst case scenario in modern society is still better than of what humanity had then you might find the strength to act and move forward it gets better and if youre resilient and creative enough you can get ahead,I Empathize with People Struggling Right Now But Honest to God a Perspective Change is Needed for Some Of These People To Survive And Then Someday Thrive It Is True A Social Contract Was Broken At Some Point We Built Society To Circumvent The Reality Is Not Guaranteed At any other points point in history you would be working all day every single day just to survive and it is stilling and stilling a guarantee yes the system has been unfairly optimized but that can change and you can also change your circumstances to rebalance it back into your favorite in fact you have to do Survival is it unfair that others might be more privileged or have been in the past but likes from stated complaining about it does nothing to help you and i mean that as sympathetically as I can want i want people to survive and get to a better place so you have to acknowledge the reality. Then move forward any way you can be to try to change it this seemed to be too emotionally heavy for people to copy with but if you just realize that all of the extra stuff was never garanteed for the most of human history. Better than what humanity had then you might find the strength to act and move forward it gets better and if youure resilient and creative enough you can get ahead,YouTube

posted this right when i needed it i hope you take a small moment out of your day to read this who ever is reading this cause i promise you it wont be a waste of your time since its a helpful piece of adviceinformation anxiety is like a fitful child think of a parent at the store and there child is taking a fit over not being able to get candy in the store they want if the parent gives into the child yelling and screaming and gets the candy to make them stop throwing a fit sure itll make the child be quiet faster but then the child will learn that taking a fit gets them what they want and will continue to do so and will even get more persistent with it but if the parent doesnt get the candy then the child will learn that screaming and taking a fit will not get them what they want if you think of it this way anxiety is a lot like a fitful child we tend to give into anxiety witch just teaches it that it can get what it wants by throwing a fit your anxiety usually wants something from you weather thats not hanging out with a friend cause of social anxiety or not decluttering cause you dont wanna deal with old things escaping with playing video games staying on your phone or looking up your symptoms on google for a little bit of reassurance cause your anxiety is yelling at you to do so but if you do it anyways and hang out with your friend or choose not to look up your symptoms your teaching your brain that taking a fit wont solve anything of course at first this may be annoying to hear this child screaming and yelling at you but if you dont give in and keep persistence eventually you will be dealing with little to no anxiety and your fitful child will understand that taking a fit doesnt get them what they want hope this helps tried making it as gender neutral as possible,Posted this right when I need it i hope you take a small moment out of your day to read this who is ever reading this cause i promise you it is a waste of your time. Child is taking a fit over not being able to get candy in the store they want the parent gaves into the child yelling and screaming and gets the candy to make them stop throwing a fit surre itll itll the child be the child being quoted faster but then Continue to do so and will even get more persistent with it but if the parent doesnt get the candy then the child will learn that screaming and taking a fit will not get them what they want you Teaches it that can get what it wants by throwing a fit your anxiety Usually Wants something Phone or looking up your symptoms on google for a little bit of reassurance cause your anxiety is yelling at you to do so but if you do it anyways and hang out with your friend or choose not to look up your symptoms your teaching This may be annoying to hear this child screenaming and yelling at you but if you dont give in and keep persistence eventually you will deal with liters US POSSIBLE NEUTRAL,YouTube

this is about the third video that is explaining a topic in a really poor manner i have no idea what the hell shes talking about seems very superficial to what ive experienced ive went through burnout myself and im still recovering with me it was a high level of physical emotional and mental exhaustion i was completely drained i reached a point where i completely dissassociated from my body i was with my partner and he was talking to me calling me even held me and i completely was unable to move or react or reply i would often feel extremely anxious on not knowing where id be able to find any kind of energy or strength to face the next day i was working about to hours per day i very often worked during weekends and on holidays this went on for basically five years i eventually starting having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts this all culminated on a stroke i suffered this march and ive been recovering ever since ive been seen by a psychiatrist a psychologist a neurologist a general practice doctordid countless exams and been on different medication since i took a medical leave of months after my stroke and went back to the same job afterwards needless to say it very quickly started all getting the same again yes the feeling of unffairness was there but that exists in every aspect of your life what is really fair anyways extrinsic rewards or whatever she was talking about seeking some kind of appreciation for what were bringing on to the table i think thats pretty normal so again dont understand how thats a symptom on my end if i would offer any kind of advice is if you ever feel and heres the important part not a bit or not just occasionally but often terribly overwhelmed do something about it right away communicate it to your line manager try to do your job during your working hours and if it proves to be impossible communicate that to your manager if even after you established boundries and provided regular and formal feedback on whats happening and nothing changes leave leave before it gets worse before your body and your health forces you to no job is worth your life i was an overachiever constantly trying to do everything and as much as possible constantly wanting to be the best possible employee i could be constantly trying to help everyone around me constantly trying to push myself and telling myself that i was strong enough to endure anything look where that got meand yes i did leave my job three weeks ago im now taking some time off and recovering at home with my partner and im still struggling on a day to day basis but i can see some small improvements already and i believe in a few months ill hopefully start feeling better and more like myself,,YouTube

so i was diagnosed with depersonalizationderealization disorder over a decade ago fortunately most of the symptoms are gone thankfully because its disconcerting to experience those dissociative symptoms randomly how my therapist described it to me and my own lived experience was that depersonalization is like living in a waking dream where youre there but not really there reality doesnt feel real and neither do you like when i looked down at my hand i wouldnt recognize it as my hand during an episode it was like i was disconnected from my body and sometimes felt as if i were floating outside of myself completely disengaged from my own sensesexperiences i didnt experience that sense of cynicism like she talked about though i guess the closest to that i experienced was just feeling emotionally numb but that was a feeling of nothingness like my emotions were under a frozen lake theyre there but i just cant access them to feel them feeling a sense of cynicism would be actually feeling that emotion though i have no doubts that my chronic stress intensified the symptoms of depersonalization not feeling like a person and derealization not feeling that reality is real though i just didnt have the phrase burnout in my vocabulary years ago i wonder if she just misspoke when she said depersonalization,,YouTube
was this video suggested to me cos i shouted too much today,,YouTube
making sure you get some free time looks away we all know it is not possible to have more free time for the people who are so frickin burnt out doing the most and getting paid the least lets be honest my escape was getting into school on student loans so i would have to be at my job less and the real block i have is asking my references for a reference because i dont want to bother them i should have quit when i got hired and it took them months to give me one shift and after being promised h per week working h per month i was too embarrassed to ask my references again so soon for a reference i knew i was locked into a horrible situation for y at least because it is not appropriate to quit i needed the money i needed the shift schedule and i didnt want to bother my references after what one told me was quite a lengthy process for a horrible horrible job deep down i actually do think of suicide,,YouTube

burnout as a biproduct of keeping someone alive is as extreme as it sounds unsolvable unless you can cure the problem perpetually increasing in difficulty until death there are things we cannot solve and they hurt us this is a painful unfair infuriating yet unshakable fact of life if youve been through the ringer like i have all i can say is im sorry,,YouTube

therere certain kind of people who dont experience burnout and in my observations these people belong to certain personality type which lack a sense of craving for individuality they thrive in their devotion and lack of personal ambitious or expectations so ive been practising to develop a sense of deliberate graduate by reminding myself all the things im grateful for in my job and it does work to certain extent,,YouTube

also important to mention its not just your job that causes burnout its a combo of everything in your life from past trauma mental health conditions an abusive marriage toxic friends or family which can vary from person to person everything in your life affects your mind and its about time we stop forcing people to separate work and personal life youre one person with the same heart and brain that goes to work and comes home everything in your life has a concious or subconcious influence on you no matter how much you suppress your body remembers hence the burn out,,YouTube
how can one deal with burnout effectively when taking a sabbatical is not on option,,YouTube

the use of the term depersonalization is inaccurate,,YouTube
that is not even a little bit what depersonalisation means youre describing irritability depersonalisation is a form of dissociation where you feel separate from yourself or your body and feel like youre experiencing your life in third person and its usually an automatic bodily response to early childhood trauma that persists into adulthood or a side effect of substances it can be an extremely trippy distressing feeling and has absolutely nothing to do with what you were talking about,,YouTube
american society is exhausting going under anesthesia for a colonoscopy was the most peaceful time of my life and i literally cried when i woke up,,YouTube
thats not what depersonalization is,,YouTube
so what if youve been feeling this exhaustion for years on end with literally no end in sight its severely impacting work ethics and quality of life in general i even think its causing some physical symptoms to manifest,,YouTube
im burned out but i dont have time to take a rest my exams in a month and i cant even study anything it started to turn to depression and i even found myself mindlessly doing selfharm when my parents kept pressuring me and blaming me for being uncaring and ungrateful for what they offer mei talked to them and they were like stop being lazy and go study,,YouTube
oxford called asking which dictionary youre using to define disassociation,,YouTube
what you talking about thats not the symptoms of depersonalization,,YouTube
i hate how overused this term is i deal with clinical burnout and feel like nobody can relate to me,,YouTube
i feel all of the syndroms but i think my depersonalization is a bit different it feels like i cant think of one more thing and just my mind is blank or there is a wall between my identity and my ability to think it is extremely foggy and just thinking my mind doesnt shut the fuck up makes me want to get out of my body,,YouTube
this might assist the circumstances combine maintained focus on a repeated sound and image only in your mind breathe full and steady inhalesexhales only through the nose allow the physical sensations of challenging emotions to fully run their course if you can when they arise to help process them avoid expectations from the process it helps to practice about five minutes every few hours you might find it to be effective,,YouTube
the world needs a break,,YouTube
i chose to look at the positives at any situation i cant get out of what i like about disrespect is no human is worth anything not even a love life i like being confronted so that i can get over my issues quickly and with efficiency rather than have thinking space and come back with a clear head its about discovering new things that will differentiate me from most of the world and when it comes to doctors warning id advise a doctor to tell their patients go out and die with the emotions that theyre experiencing they cant help but complain and expressing their feelings rather than get their job done self worth is what missing here,,YouTube
i know what i need to do now,,YouTube

i see a wide interpretation of the word burnout in the english language it makes it difficult to have a reasonable discussion when some people think its just sort of feeling tired alot and others such as olympic athletes have lower cortisol responses leading to severe near mobility impairing paralysis severe sleeping disorders while their bodies check out as perfectly healthy under lab tests serious medical studies focus on air traffic controllers medical doctors and military veterans who actually get exercise and sleep yet show burnout symptoms while common word choice by college students is im so burned out because they havent slept enough pulled all nighters etc people are using the same words to describe vastly different things is a huge problem with the word burnout,I see a wide interpretation of the word burnout in the english language it makes it dictiont to have a reasonable discussion when someone thinks Paralysis Severe Sleeping Disorders While Bodies Check Out As Perfectly Healthy Under Lab Tests Serious Medical Studies Focus On Air Traffic Controllers Medical Doctors And Military Veterans Who Actually Get Exercise And Sleep College Students are im so burned out because they have sled enghugh all nighters etc.,YouTube

so i was beyond burnout several times before in my life i was not only emotionally exhausted depersonalized or having a sense of ineffectiveness it was way beyond that it was total cognitive shut down and emotional strain i absolutely couldnt process any more piece of information or develop thoughts on anything it led me to severe depression and complete passive response to any stimuli and that was not because i didnt try it was because really could not it was simply beyond my capacity at the time it seemed like being a zombie i suffer from severe memory loss both shortterm and longterm nowadays i cant even work for hours a day in the dayweek system now and still have to deal with the absolute same conditions that led me to that living with elder complicated parents who seem to live in a parallel reality i cant afford my way out of it because i am an autistic adult with severe add inattentive type who cant be normal so cant find any position that would suit me does anybody can give a further insight about what my issue is i suspect everything derives from autism diagnosed lvl but most prolly lvl since i cant understand much non verbal communication actually almost none at all i am from brazil by the way the discussion on mental health is way lower than that from the usa and elsewhere no proper treatment unless you are rich and way less social understanding compassion its you for yourself only the law of the fittest cant survive bummer,so I was beyond burnout as a several time before in my life I was not only emotionally exhausted depersonalized or having a sense of ineffectiveness it was way beyond that it was total cognitive shut down and emotional strain I absolutely couldnt processes any more piece of information or developing Anything it Led me to severe depression and complete passive response to any stimuli and that was not because I didnt try it was because really could be able to simply beyond my capacity at the time it seemed like a zombie I suffer I can even work for hours a day in the dayweek system now and still have to deal with the absolute same condition that led me to that living with elder complicated parents who seem to live in a parallel reality i cant afford my way out of it because Inattentive Type Who Cant Be Normal So Cant Find Any Position That Would Suit Me Does Anybody Can Give a Further Insight About What My Issue is I suspect everything. Communication actually almost none at all I am from Brazil by the way the discussion on mental health is way lower than that from the usa and elsewhere no proper treatment unless you are rich and way less social understanding,YouTube

most of burn out is caused by greed and not because of our system our system is a good one the problem is its no longer enough to do a good job you must do more to be considered to be a good employee for example my uncle was a history teacher the school had no drivers ed program so he started one and ran it thats what i mean by you must do more my uncle was lucky in that he had the talent to see the situation and then instigate it its ridiculous that every employee must also do the same you must see where there is a need in your company then meet that need you cant just do a good job for which you were hired if you dont have this talent you do not have blessings of the company you work for there is nothing wrong with the usas system the system we have here is a good one the problem is the people who vote for the idiots who got us into this mess i remember we used to have weeks vacation week sick pay we had excellent health insurance we had secure jobs for life and a guaranteed retirement and you could go on that week vacation and not have to worry if you had a job when you got back now you must compete with someone who lives for pennies a day in a third world country,"Most of Burn out is caousted by greed and not because systems of our system is a good one the problem is no longer enough to do a good job you must do more to be relared to be a good employee for Examples my uncle.

hi there although i like and agree with the content too bad it only is reflected from a job standpoint also the proposed solution to handle a beginning burnout is only reachable when you have money and a boss who is emphatic in real life the situation is very different from that lots of people have no money even to go on a prolonged holiday or a holiday at all let alone a sabbatical next to this telling your boss you need more time for your family or yourself will not be received well it will only give you more tension at work and i know because ive been through years of all kinds of these situations and advices only to see that those didnt match reality and made things worse now i am at home with cptsd no life goals no money no friends no partner and without money you will never ever get one as a man only by lying and thats exactly a point i hate in people only negative things no positive to compensate for those and to give a sense of live is worth something so i am and my road of live ended about years ago already only to stay alive as to not hurt my kids who live with my exwife so i also do not see them much the rest of the time i am just sitting at home waiting for my live to pass and finally get the rest i want when i die no health care organisation brought anything they claim in brochures or on their websites also organisations that relay people to those others are convinced everything is as it looks when complaining it is not they just say you are the one who is lying and keep continuing relaying people to organisations who do not do a thing only cashing money for a few months and leave the patient or client just as they were before or even worse so how do you address these things i am not the only one i guess and there must be thousands of people like me around,hi there althouch i like and agree with the content too bad it only is reflected from a job standpoint also the proposed solution to handle a beginning burnout is only reachable when you have money and a boss who is emphatic in real life the situation is very different from the people have no money even to go on a prolongated holiday or a holiday at all let alone a sabbatical next to this telling your boss you need more time for your family or yourself will not be received well it will only give you more tension at work and I know because I been years old kinds of these situations and advices only to see that those didnt match reality and made things worse now i am at home with cptsd no life goals no money no friends no partner and without money you will never ever get one as a man only by lying and thats exactly a point i hate in people Only negative things that no positive to compensate for those and to give a sense of live is worth something so I am and my road of live ended about years ago already only to stay alive as to not hurt my kids who live with my exwife so i also do not see them much them waiting for my live to pass and finally get the rest i want when i die no health care organization Brought Anything they claims in brochures or on their websites also organications that relay people to those others and keep continuing relaying people to organization who do not do a thing only cashing money for a few months and leave the patient or client just as they are before or even so so do you address Like me around,YouTube

do not listen to this lady this is the worst burnout video ive ever seen i was looking for something to explain to my husband exactly what burn out is this video started out but you quickly begin to realize this woman has a job that allows her to take half a year off this woman has no children and can sit around and play guitar hero to relieve herself from burn out this might be the most tone deaf thing i have ever watched i do not dislike this woman and i do not think this was intentional but because of her nature of work its not really acceptable i understand cool it was hard and i believe everybody got burned out in some way or another im still suffering from it and im trying to figure it all out you guys probably are too but most of you did not get to check out whatever you do in life to get yourself back on track now heres the next thing i realize her target audience may not have a lot of marriages or parental issues some of you were just too young or havent reached that part of your life were you ready for that thats but what a video like this does tells you that its when you have a family with responsibilities and a job that doesnt give you a sabbatical to take care of just yourself and maybe play some guitar hero i think it is important for everyone out there especially the ones that do not know what burnout in parenting is light to understand us and she totally didnt touch on it its important to note for your future because you dont know it until you liv it my husband is a firefighter and works sometimes three days at a time which prevents me from having a normal job it prevented me from having a job at all during covid shut downs and during two hurricanes in louisiana living in a camper psychologist call what i do third shift it means even after your job is over you still have to pick up another shift because a family is work its actually harder work than showing up to work going mindless and making a paycheck most of the time the hardest part of parental burn out is when parenting no longer feels rewarding and the guilt of that crushes you because you love your children so why arent you happy why isnt this rewarding what do you do all summer long when youre exhausted and burn out but your kids have been out of school for three months you have no free will besides a little wiggle room around the house doctors appointments that appointment laundry dishes floor care getting the kids in the bath or the shower washing the dogs cleaning toilets thats just a list a few things and at the end of the night after everyone has been bathed you make sure everyone brush their teeth and got a snack before they brush their teeth its going to be about oclock at that point you have to decide would you like some free time to do anything like watch a youtube video or do you have enough energy to stand up and take a shower because the shower is your free time so to get through the next day you tell yourself its they will grow at one day and you will have time to yourself again that bought goes along with extreme guilt and depression knowing that your children are growing up and then one of a teenager and will leave the house eventually and you will have missed all this time with him just feeling awful and wanting something for yourself that sense of loss and selfishness will crush you if you have any hard at all this might have been the most misinformed self entitled toni death video on this i have seen again i do not mean that to hurt this woman but until she hears it somewhere she will never understand that and in her line of work she really should take that into account massively just like i hope some of you hear who might not have a family or those type of responsibilities well understand and take it incredibly serious and even consider what you would do in a situation like this because there is no time to space out and play games or take a week off or even a half a year off from your job your job is a stay at home parent who pays bills cooks claims and does literally everything except bring home a check and get a break from the house think about it and have a plan,do not listen to this lady this is the a word burnout video Ive ever see I was looking for something to explain to my husband exactly what burn out is this video starting out but you Quickly begin to realize this woman has a job that alls to take

i find that the exhaustion caused by the current state of the us laboring system is causing more burnout in the population however due to increasing acceptance of mental health conditions and the resulting spread of easily accessible mental health information to the public people who are simply experiencing exhaustion have been classifying themselves as burnt out as someone who experiences clinical burnout this has brought me to many personal experiences when in telling someone i am burnt out there is an expectation placed upon me to simply keep going the misidentification of burnout by those experiencing exhaustion leads to the belief that burnout is simply a period of low energy and not a potentially dangerous mental health condition this then leads to the mistreatment of those experiencing clinical burnout placing them in a position that may worsen their condition there is also a heavy expectation which this video promotes that burnout is a set of specific symptoms that occur in a neurotypical format in reality especially for those who are neurodivergent burnout is a collection of ranging symptoms that have the ability to fluctuate burnout for a neurodivergent brain is going to show a different collection of potential symptoms than those identified for neurotypical people a few of which are shared in this video this perpetuation that burnout only occurs in ways the neurotypical brain conceives makes it more difficult for neurodivergent people to identify when they are in a period of burnout especially for those who are alexithymic this also means that treatment for burnout as recommended for neurotypical burnout isnt always successful in treating burnout for neurodivergent people im glad that big think has made a video detailing burnout to help those experiencing it identify their condition but i am dissatisfied with the lack of explanation and acceptance of different types of burnout,I find that the exhaustion caused by the current state of the us laboratory system is causing more burnout in the population howver due to the mental health condition and the resulating spreads of the easily accessible health information to the public. have been classifying themselves as burnt out as someone who experiences clinical burnout this has broken me to many personal experiences when in telling someone i am burnt out there is an expectation placed upon me to simply going the misidentification Leads to the belief that burnout is simply a period of low energy and not a potential dangerous mental health condition this time leads to the missing of those experiences. Promotes that burnout is a set of specific symptoms that occur in a neurotypical format in reality especially for those who are neurodivergen burnout is a collection of ranging symptoms that have the above the abilities to fluctuator for a neurodiver. Collection of Potential Symptoms than those identified for neurotypical people a few of which are shared in this video this rigging that burnout only occurs in ways the neurotypical brain conceives of burnout estially for those who are alexithymic this also means that treatment for burnout as recommended for neurotypical burnout isnt always successful in treating burning for neurodiver. it identify their condition but i am dispened with the lack of explanation and acceptance of different types of burnout,YouTube

so the cause of burnout is called psycosocial hazards in australia and should be addressed as part of occupational health and saftey the very first individual treatment is to see it as a workplace problem not a you problem because if your burnt out odds are your coworkers are suffering too so reach out to your peers and support one another to get help your industryjob should have a occupational health and saftey rep or first aid officer you can talk to about the problems and can provide support and help to fixing them if you dont have this check online to find out what laws apply in your countrystate and reach out to a union or form a group at work or with peers to help support you and fight for change it is total nonsense to expect a person with burnout to go it alone in quitting work or fighting a unsafe workplace instead reach out talk about your problems and make friends because you are not alone and together its much easier to fight back or get treatment when you know your legal rights have people to support you and use workers compensation or laws to fix the problems,So the cause of burnout is calling psychcosocial hazards in Australia and should be addressed as part of occupational health and saftey the very first individual treatment is to see it So reach out to your peers and support one another to get help your industryjob should have a occupational health and saftey rep or first aid offer you can talk to about the problems and can provide support and help to fix them if you do this your countrystate and reach out to a union or form a group at work or with peers to help support you and fight for change it is total nonsense to expect a person with burnout to go it alone in quitting work or fighting a unsafe workplace You are not alone and Together its much easier to fight back or get treatment when you know your legal rights have people to support you and use workers compensation or laws to fix the problems,YouTube

as someone born in the us but living the last years in the netherlands its very interesting to see how differently the subject of burnout is addressed in each country in the us the best burnout treatment most people can hope for is a compassionate boss that will help prioritize your mental health by making small temporary adjustments to your workload in the netherlands youre able to take up to two years off with a government mandated minimum of your pay to allow you to focus on your mental health and truly treat your symptoms and many companies will even add additional pay up to of your salary and yes we do pay high taxes for the privilege of prioritizing mental health other healthcare transportation education etc but in my mind its absolutely worth every penny to know that if and when i need help im able to seek it regardless of preexisting conditions or financial pressures not trying to push this structure on anyone else just some food for thought for those that might share a similar vision for a balanced and secure human existence,as someone born in the us but living the last years in the netherlands its very interesting to see how differently the subject of burnout is addressed in each country Making small temporary adjustments to your workload in the netherlands Youure able to take up to two years off with a government mandated minimum of your pay to allow you to focus on your mental health and Truly Treat Your Symptoms and many compans will event Pay High Taxes for the Privilege of Prioritizing Mental Health Other Healthcare Transportation Education etc. but in my mind absolutely worth every penny to know that if and when I need help imle to seek it regardless of preexisting conditions Anyone else just some food for those,YouTube
i think the second one can be tricky the it feels like if theres one more request youre just gonna lose it and freak out because while i sometimes feel like if theres one more request i dont know what i can do i know i wont lose it and freak out because thats not what i do ever its not in my personality type to do that i help i fix things i help other people i dont lose it and freak out thats not an option maybe ill shut down maybe ill quit maybe ill get sick tho i hate that because the last thing i need is time away from work where things keep piling up while im not there not sure but probably more likely ill just try to do whatever is neededexpected and keep those feelings internal thinking that at some point in the future maybe something will get better even tho it hasnt in three years and i know that and when someone asks me how things are going ill say its crazy but well get there because i cant just say the first part,"I think the second one can be tricky the feels like if theres one more request you are just gonna lose it and freak out because while I have some Ever its not in my personality type to do that I help I fix things that I help other people I dont lose it and freak out that not an option may be shut down maybe quit quit may be sick tho I hate that the because while im not surre but probably more likeyy Ill just try to do whatever is neededexpected and keep those in internal thinking that at some points in the future maybe something Things are going, ILL ITS crazy but well get there because I can just say the first part",YouTube

this was a great video but i dislike how burnout is always discussed specifically in work contexts i burned out earlier this year when completing my phd but had also started a masters at the same time and was working as well to earn an income i didnt have the physical or emotional energy to take care of myself and i didnt have the option to take breaks i would love for more information about how long it can take to recover from burnout and different ways recovering can look ive been on break now for the past three weeks and its the first break ive had in four years i dont want to do a single thing but feel guilty for not being more productive so this is why id love for someone to discuss burnout from a perspective other than work burnout because the advice is often very workplace specific eg make changes in the workplace etc,This was a great video but I dislike how burnout is always discussed specifically in working contexts i burned out earlier this year when completing my phd but had also started a master at the same time and was working as well.

here where you are now turns out to be something else than you had expected and not for the better go back to the beginning ask yourself what was that that first inspired you what gave you the energy to do what you do best go back to that rediscover that in my view the biggest mistake you can make is going past your boundaries gradually at first and then systematically your mind is warning you but you are not listening mind and body decouple without a sense of intrinsic boundaries you have lost a sense of yourself you are lost everything else becomes too much you know what you feel you just dont now why you feel the way you do anymore you cant pint point it and that only amplifies the ill condition counseling coaching therapy yeah that helps some but not all shortterm solution a more sustainable solution is reprogramming yourself the mind is probability calculation machine you need to relearn that what you do has high probability of a positive return find what first inspired you start very simple do it over and over again and build on that until your mind relearns that you have a positive effect on yourself and environment in my case i fixed a cabinet door and ended up renovating my house at each iteration my mind gets to take in a tangible result of my efforts a positive and constructive feedback mind and body realign very good information being able to clarify or otherwise validate what you are experiencing is the first step towards gaining some sense of relief and formulating a plan to recovery,Here where you are now turn out to be something else than you had expected and not for the better go back to the beginning ask yourself what was that first inspired you what you know you the energy to do what you do back to that the rediscover boundaries gradually at first and then systematically your mind is warning you but you are not listening to mind and body decouple without you feel of intrinsic boundaries you have lost of yourself you are lost everything else becomes.

i would have liked a last piece about recovering from established long term burnout this is the hardest because the preventative measures probably still apply but they take on the quality of more things you are supposed to be doing more demands my one criticism of the piece is that i think limiting burnout to work factors creates an incomplete picture personal demands can definitely play a role single moms is probably the most often cited though in my case an elderly parent was the biggest factor the reason i got served this clip is that long term burnout is a big topic at the moment on the neurodivergent channels adhd and autism neurodivergence adds some tricky variables it certainly can make you more vulnerable to burnout and certain neurodivergent traits strongly resemble the symptoms of burnout which makes untangling what is a result of what that much harder not least because some of the traits that resemble burnout may in fact come from experiencing the causes of burnout throughout all areas of a neurodivergent persons life these days this type of ongoing stress is often misattributed as trauma and i appreciate that this piece talks about stress as a root i do feel a need to clarify one last thing about that however burnout as an outcome is distinguishable from stress but it flows from persistent stress if you are trying to preempt burnout its very important not to fall into looking at your situation and going its just stress theres nothing just about stress no one can live a stress free life just as no one can avoid being exposed to any carcinogens but too much of either too constantly is likely to lead to health problems and in the case of stress those problems are often mental health related alas the concerns often get applied only to whether you have a heart attack or a stroke but many of us can tell you that breakdowns can be debilitating too persistent stress does damage to all systems especially the prefrontal cortex it is long past time for business and society to stop pretending that what does not kill us makes us stronger,I would have liked a last piece about recovering from established long term burnout this is the hardest because the preventive measures probably still apply but they take on the quality of more that you are supposed to be doing more demands Work factors creates an incomplete picture personal demand can definitely play a role moms is probably the most off though in my case an elderly parent was the biggest factor the reason i gear served this is that long Channels Adhd and Autism NeurodiverGence Adds Some Tricky Variables IT Certyly Can Make You More Vulnerable to Burnout and Certain Neurodivergen Traits Strongly Resemble The Symptoms Of Burnout Which Which. of the traits that are reserved burnout may in fact come from experience in the causes of burnout through all of the neurodivergen persons life these days Feel a need to clarify one last thing about that about the howver burnout as an outcome is distinguishable from stress but it flows from persistent stress if you are trying to preempt burnout its very important not to fall into looking at your situation and going Live a stress free life just as no one can avoid being exposed to any carcinogens but too much of either too constantly is likely to lead to health problems and in the case of stress those problems a heart attack or a stroke but many of us can tell you that breakdowns can be debilitating too persistent stress does damage to all systems especially the prefrontal cortex it is long past time for business and society to stop pretending this what not kill us make us stonger,YouTube
